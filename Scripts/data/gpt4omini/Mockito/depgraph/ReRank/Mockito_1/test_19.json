    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldStubBooleanVarargs` is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` that occurs in the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method. This suggests that the issue is likely related to how arguments are being processed or matched.\n\n2. The `InvocationMatcher` constructor is responsible for initializing matchers based on the invocation's arguments. If the matchers are not set up correctly, it could lead to issues when handling varargs, making this method highly suspicious.\n\n3. The `matches` method checks if the mock matches the actual invocation. If the invocation is not set up correctly or if the mock is not properly configured, this could lead to the `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\n4. The `getInvocation` method simply returns the invocation and is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure.\n\n5. The `MockHandlerImpl` and `InvocationNotifierHandler` constructors initialize various components related to mocking. If any of these components are not set up correctly, it could lead to issues during method invocation.\n\n6. The `defaultAnswer` method sets a default answer for the mock, which seems less directly related to the current failure.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- **Method ID 2 (InvocationMatcher)**: Ensure that the matchers are correctly initialized based on the invocation's arguments. The line `this.matchers = matchers;` should be checked to ensure it is not overwriting the matchers initialized from `ArgumentsProcessor.argumentsToMatchers(invocation.getArguments())`.\n\n- **Method ID 0 (matches)**: Add additional checks to ensure that the mock and actual invocation are properly configured before performing the equality check. This could prevent the `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\n- **Method ID 1 (getInvocation)**: No changes needed as it simply returns the invocation.\n\n- **Method ID 42 (MockHandlerImpl)**: Ensure that the `mockSettings` passed to the constructor are valid and properly initialized.\n\n- **Method ID 13 (InvocationNotifierHandler)**: Validate that the `mockHandler` and `settings` are correctly set up before using them.\n\n- **Method ID 26 (defaultAnswer)**: No changes needed as it seems less related to the failure.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 2**: InvocationMatcher (most suspicious)\n2. **Method ID 0**: matches\n3. **Method ID 42**: MockHandlerImpl\n4. **Method ID 13**: InvocationNotifierHandler\n5. **Method ID 1**: getInvocation\n6. **Method ID 26**: defaultAnswer (least suspicious)\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 42,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
