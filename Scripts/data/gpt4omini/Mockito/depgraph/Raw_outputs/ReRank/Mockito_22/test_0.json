"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method ID 0 (`areArrayElementsEqual`)**: This method checks if the elements of two arrays are equal by calling `areEqual` on each element. The stack trace indicates that the problem arises from the `areEqual` method, which is directly invoked here. This makes it highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Method ID 3 (`areEqual`)**: This method is the main entry point for equality checks. It handles null checks and array comparisons, relying on `areArraysEqual` for array objects. While it has a fallback for non-array objects, it is still suspicious due to its reliance on `areArraysEqual`, which in turn relies on `areEqual`. \n\n3. **Method ID 1 (`areArraysEqual`)**: This method checks if two arrays have the same length but does not perform the actual element comparison. It relies on `areArrayLengthsEqual`, which is not shown in the stack trace. While it could lead to issues, it is less suspicious than the other two methods as it does not directly invoke `areEqual`.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **Method ID 0**: Ensure that `areEqual` handles all types of objects correctly, including edge cases like arrays of different lengths or types. Add checks to prevent `Array.get` from being called on null objects.\n  \n- **Method ID 3**: Improve the handling of array comparisons by ensuring that `areArraysEqual` is robust and can handle different types of arrays. Also, ensure that the fallback for non-array objects is correctly implemented.\n\n- **Method ID 1**: Implement the actual element comparison logic in `areArraysEqual` to ensure that it not only checks lengths but also compares the contents of the arrays.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\n1. **Method ID 0**: Most suspicious due to direct reliance on `areEqual`.\n2. **Method ID 3**: Second most suspicious due to its role as the entry point for equality checks.\n3. **Method ID 1**: Least suspicious as it only checks lengths without invoking `areEqual`.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
