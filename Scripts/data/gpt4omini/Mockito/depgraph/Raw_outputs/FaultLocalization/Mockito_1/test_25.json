"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `shouldRemoveAllStubbing` is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException`. This exception is likely related to the handling of mock objects in the Mockito framework, particularly when resetting mocks and stubbing methods.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'matches' method checks if the mock in the invocation matches the actual invocation's mock. If the mocks are not set up correctly or if the invocation is not properly captured, this could lead to an UnsupportedOperationException when trying to reset or match invocations.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor for InvocationMatcher initializes matchers based on the invocation's arguments. If the matchers are not set up correctly or if the invocation is invalid, it could lead to issues when trying to match invocations, potentially causing the exception seen in the stack trace.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The MockHandlerImpl constructor initializes various components related to mocking. If any of these components are not set up correctly, it could lead to issues when handling invocations, which might be related to the UnsupportedOperationException.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getInvocation' method simply returns the invocation. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the exception, if the invocation is not valid or properly initialized, it could contribute to the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The NullResultGuardian is a wrapper around the InternalMockHandler. While it may not directly cause the exception, if the delegate is not functioning correctly, it could lead to issues when handling method calls.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The confirm method validates settings for mock creation. If the settings are incorrect, it could lead to issues later on, but it is less directly related to the current exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'when' method is used to set up stubbing for method calls. While it is essential for mocking, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the UnsupportedOperationException in this context.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
