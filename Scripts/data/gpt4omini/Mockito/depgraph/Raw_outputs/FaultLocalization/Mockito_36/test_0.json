"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test is failing due to a `NoSuchMethodError` when trying to call a real method on a mocked interface. This indicates that there is an issue with the method invocation, particularly with the way the mock is set up or how the real method is being called.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'callRealMethod' is directly responsible for invoking the real method on the mock. The failure in the test indicates that this method is trying to call a method that does not exist, which is likely the cause of the NoSuchMethodError.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'Invocation' constructor initializes the invocation context, including the real method. If the real method is not set up correctly, it could lead to the NoSuchMethodError when 'callRealMethod' is invoked.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getMethod' method retrieves the MockitoMethod associated with the invocation. If this method does not return the correct method, it could contribute to the failure when trying to call the real method.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'when' method is used to set up the stubbing for the mock. If the stubbing is not set up correctly, it could lead to issues when the real method is called, but it is less directly related to the failure than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getSpiedInstance' method simply returns the spied instance. It does not directly influence the method invocation or the error, making it the least suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
