"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `should_capture_all_vararg` is failing due to an assertion error. The expected output was a list containing the strings `[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"again ?!\"]`, but the actual output was a list containing integers `[42, 42]`. This indicates that the method responsible for capturing the arguments is not functioning as expected.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to argument capturing and verification in Mockito. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom`** - This method is responsible for capturing arguments from the invocation. If it fails to capture the correct arguments, it could lead to the observed failure.\n2. **`org.mockito.ArgumentCaptor:getAllValues`** - This method retrieves all captured values. If the capturing mechanism is flawed, this method would return incorrect values.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches`** - This method checks if the invocation matches the expected invocation. If it does not match correctly, it could lead to incorrect argument capturing.\n4. **`org.mockito.Mockito:verify`** - This method is used to verify that a method was called with specific arguments. If the verification fails, it could indicate that the arguments were not captured correctly.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.matchers.CapturingMatcher:getAllValues`** - Similar to `ArgumentCaptor:getAllValues`, this method retrieves values captured by a matcher. If the matcher is not capturing correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 5, 6, 14]\n}\n```"
