"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `creates_instances_of_inner_classes` is failing due to an `InstantiationException` when trying to create an instance of `SomeInnerClass`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `ConstructorInstantiator` class, specifically in the `withOuterClass` method, which is responsible for creating instances of inner classes that require an outer class instance.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **withOuterClass**: This method attempts to get a constructor of the inner class that takes the outer class instance as a parameter. If the outer class instance is not of the correct type or if the inner class does not have a parameter-less constructor, this method will fail.\n2. **paramsException**: This method is called when an exception occurs in the `withOuterClass` method. While it does not directly cause the failure, it is part of the error handling and could provide insights into the nature of the failure.\n3. **newInstance**: This method is responsible for creating a new instance of the class. It checks if the `outerClassInstance` is null and calls `withOuterClass`. If the outer class instance is not set correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n4. **ConstructorInstantiator constructor**: This constructor initializes the `outerClassInstance`. If this instance is not set correctly when creating the `ConstructorInstantiator`, it could lead to issues in the methods that depend on it.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n```"
