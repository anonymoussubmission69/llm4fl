"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCallsRealInterfaceMethod` is failing due to an attempt to call a real method on a mock of an interface, which is not allowed. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `CallsRealMethods.answer` method when it tries to invoke `invocation.callRealMethod()`.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`CallsRealMethods.answer`**: This method is directly involved in the failure as it attempts to call a real method on a mock.\n2. **`MockSettingsImpl.defaultAnswer`**: This method sets the default answer for the mock, which could influence how the mock behaves when methods are called.\n3. **`Mockito.withSettings`**: This method is used to create mock settings, which may include the default answer.\n4. **`MockCreationValidator.validateMockedType`**: This method validates the type being mocked, which could be relevant if the type is an interface.\n5. **`MockHandlerImpl.handle`**: This method handles the invocation on the mock, and could be involved in the process of calling the real method.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 0, 2, 13, 28]\n}\n```"
