"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `abstractMethodReturnsDefault` is failing due to an attempt to call an abstract method on a mocked object. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when the `fullName()` method is called on an instance of `AbstractThing`, which is being mocked using Mockito's `spy` method. The error message specifically states that calling real methods is only possible when mocking non-abstract methods.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods:answer`** - This method is responsible for calling the real method on the mock. Since the test is trying to call a real method on an abstract class, this method is directly related to the failure.\n   \n2. **`org.mockito.Mockito:spy`** - This method is used to create a spy of the `AbstractThing` class. The way this method is used in the test could be contributing to the issue.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:defaultAnswer`** - This method sets the default answer for the mock. If the default answer is not set correctly, it could lead to the failure when trying to call the real method.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockCreationValidator:validateMockedType`** - This method validates the type being mocked. If the validation does not account for abstract classes properly, it could lead to the observed issue.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle`** - This method handles the invocation on the mock. If it does not handle abstract methods correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:callRealMethod`** - This method is invoked when trying to call the real method on the mock. If it does not handle abstract methods correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 5, 0, 14, 28, 1]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the failure as indicated by the stack trace and their relevance to the mocking process in Mockito."
