"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `exception_message_when_constructor_not_found` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` which indicates that the expected behavior was not met. The test is attempting to use the `spy` method from the `Mockito` library, which is likely related to mocking behavior in the code.\n\nThe stack trace points to the line in the test where the failure occurred, which is related to the `spy` method. The `spy` method is used to create a spy of a class, and if the constructor of the class cannot be found, it may lead to an exception being thrown.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the Mockito library, particularly those related to mocking and validation. The following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.Mockito:spy`** - This is the method directly invoked in the test and is likely the source of the issue.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockCreationValidator:validateConstructorUse`** - This method validates the use of constructors in mocking, which could be relevant if the constructor is not found.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.GlobalConfiguration:getAnnotationEngine`** - This method is part of the configuration process for Mockito and may affect how mocks are created.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:validatedSettings`** - This method validates settings for mock creation, which could be relevant if there are issues with the settings being used.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockUtil:isTypeMockable`** - This method checks if a type can be mocked, which is crucial if the class being spied on has restrictions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 5, 2, 8, 25]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be investigated further to determine the root cause of the test failure."
