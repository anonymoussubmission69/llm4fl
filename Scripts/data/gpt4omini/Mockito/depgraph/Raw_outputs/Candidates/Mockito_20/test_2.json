"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `can_create_mock_with_constructor` is failing because it expected the `mock.getMessage()` to return \"hey!\", but it returned `null`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the way the mock is being created or initialized.\n\nThe stack trace points to the `assertEquals` method in the JUnit framework, which suggests that the problem lies in the mocked object's behavior, specifically in how the constructor is being used or how the mock is set up.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods related to the creation and configuration of mocks in Mockito. Here are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations:initMocks`** - This method initializes mocks and may not be setting up the mock correctly.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.GlobalConfiguration:getAnnotationEngine`** - This method retrieves the annotation engine, which could affect how mocks are configured.\n3. **`org.mockito.Mockito:withSettings`** - This method is used to configure the mock settings, which might not be set correctly.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:validatedSettings`** - This method validates the settings for mock creation, which could lead to issues if the settings are incorrect.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockCreationValidator:validateConstructorUse`** - This method validates the use of constructors in mocks, which is directly related to the test that is failing.\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:defaultAnswer`** - This method sets the default answer for the mock, which could affect the return value of `getMessage()`.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 12, 11]\n}\n```"
