"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldStubbingWork` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` when asserting that the iterator of an `Iterable` is not null. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `assertNotNull` method, which suggests that the expected behavior of the `when` method from Mockito is not being fulfilled.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the Mockito library, particularly those related to stubbing and invocation matching. The following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:stub()`** - This method is responsible for pulling the ongoing stubbing. If it returns null, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n2. **`org.mockito.Mockito:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)`** - This method is used to set up the stubbing for the method call. If the method call is not properly stubbed, it could result in a null iterator.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)`** - Similar to the previous method, this is an internal implementation that handles the stubbing process.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/Invocation;)`** - This method checks if the invocation matches the expected mock. If there is a mismatch, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:hasSameMethod(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/Invocation;)`** - This method checks if the method of the invocation matches. If there is an issue here, it could affect the stubbing process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]\n}\n```"
