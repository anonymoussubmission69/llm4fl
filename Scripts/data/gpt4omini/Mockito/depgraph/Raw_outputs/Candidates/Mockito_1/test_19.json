"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `shouldStubBooleanVarargs` is attempting to stub a method `withBooleanVarargs` on a mock object. The test fails with an `UnsupportedOperationException`, which indicates that the method being called is not supported in the current context.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the exception originates from the `InvocationMatcher` class, specifically in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. This suggests that the issue may be related to how arguments are being matched or captured during the invocation of the mocked method.\n\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include several methods from the `InvocationMatcher`, `MockHandlerImpl`, and other related classes. These methods are involved in the process of handling method calls on mocks, argument matching, and stubbing behavior.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches`\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:getInvocation`\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>`\n- `org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:<init>`\n- `org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle`\n- `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:defaultAnswer`\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the invocation handling and argument matching process, which is where the failure occurs.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 42, 13, 26]\n}\n```"
