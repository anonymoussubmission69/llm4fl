"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom`** (method_id: 0)\n   - This method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` when it encounters a varargs method. The stack trace indicates that this method was involved in the failure.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:hasSameMethod`** (method_id: 1)\n   - This method checks if two invocations have the same method. It may be indirectly related to the failure if the method signature matching fails.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:stubVoid`** (method_id: 2)\n   - This method is responsible for stubbing void methods. If there is an issue with how void methods are stubbed, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.Mockito:when`** (method_id: 8)\n   - This method is used to set up stubbing for method calls. If the stubbing is not set up correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle`** (method_id: 47)\n   - This method is part of the mock handling process. If there is an issue in how mocks are handled, it could propagate errors.\n\nThe methods listed above are interconnected, and issues in one could lead to failures in others, especially in the context of mocking and stubbing behavior in Mockito.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 8, 47]\n}\n```"
