"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches`** - This method is involved in matching invocations and could be related to the UnsupportedOperationException that occurred during the test.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:getInvocation`** - This method retrieves the invocation, which is crucial for the matching process and could be a point of failure.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>`** - The constructor initializes the invocation matcher, and any issues here could propagate to the matching logic.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle`** - This method handles the invocation and could be directly related to the exception thrown.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.NullResultGuardian:handle`** - This method is part of the handling chain and could also be a source of the issue.\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:validatedSettings`** - This method validates settings for mock creation, which could affect how mocks are handled in the test.\n7. **`org.mockito.Mockito:when`** - This method is used to set up stubbing in the test, and any issues here could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate through the others, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 3, 47, 19, 36, 7]\n}\n```"
