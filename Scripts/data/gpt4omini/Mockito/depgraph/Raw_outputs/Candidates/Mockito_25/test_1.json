"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `will_return_default_value_on_non_mockable_nested_generic` is failing due to a `ClassCastException`. This indicates that there is an issue with type casting, likely related to the mocking framework being used (Mockito in this case).\n\n2. The stack trace points to line 97 in the test, which involves assertions on the return values of mocked objects. The failure suggests that the mocked object is not returning the expected type, leading to the `ClassCastException`.\n\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include several methods from the `ReturnsDeepStubs` class, which is responsible for handling deep stubs in Mockito. The methods involved in the failure are likely related to the creation and handling of mocks.\n\n4. The methods that are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further include:\n   - `answer(InvocationOnMock invocation)`: This method is responsible for providing the answer to a method invocation on a mock. If the return type is not handled correctly, it could lead to casting issues.\n   - `recordDeepStubMock(InvocationOnMock invocation, InvocationContainerImpl container)`: This method records a deep stub mock, and if the type is not correctly inferred, it could lead to the observed exception.\n   - `getMock(InvocationOnMock invocation)`: This method retrieves the mock for the invocation, and any issues in the mock retrieval process could propagate the casting error.\n   - `isTypeMockable(Class<?> clz)`: This method checks if a class can be mocked. If it incorrectly identifies a class as mockable, it could lead to runtime exceptions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 22]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the mocking process and their potential to cause the observed `ClassCastException`."
