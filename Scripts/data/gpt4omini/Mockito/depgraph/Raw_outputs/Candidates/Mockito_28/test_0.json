"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `mock_should_be_injected_once_and_in_the_best_matching_type` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected object is not the same as the actual object. This suggests that there is an issue with the injection of mocks, likely related to the methods involved in the injection process.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n\n1. **orderedInstanceFieldsFrom**: This method retrieves and sorts the declared fields of a class. If the fields are not ordered correctly, it could lead to incorrect injection.\n2. **injectMocksOnFields**: This method is responsible for injecting mocks into the fields of the test class instance. If there is a problem in this method, it could directly cause the failure observed in the test.\n3. **injectMockCandidate**: This method filters and injects mock candidates into the fields. If the filtering logic is incorrect, it could lead to the wrong mock being injected.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure and the methods involved, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the mock injection process, and any issues within them could propagate and lead to the observed test failure."
