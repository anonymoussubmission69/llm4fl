"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is failing due to a `NotSerializableException` related to the `ReturnsDeepStubs` class from Mockito. The test attempts to serialize a mock object created with deep stubs, which is not serializable. \n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **ReturnsDeepStubs:withSettingsUsing** - This method is involved in setting up the mock with deep stubs.\n2. **ReturnsDeepStubs:answer** - This method handles the invocation on the mock and may be involved in the serialization process.\n3. **ReturnsDeepStubs:getMock** - This method retrieves the mock object and could be related to how the mock is structured.\n4. **ReturnsDeepStubs:createNewDeepStubMock** - This method creates a new deep stub mock, which is likely where the serialization issue originates.\n5. **MockCreationValidator:validateSerializable** - This method validates if the mock is serializable, which is directly related to the exception thrown.\n6. **CreationSettings:isSerializable** - This method checks if the settings for the mock indicate that it is serializable.\n7. **MockUtil:isTypeMockable** - This method checks if the type being mocked is mockable, which could affect the serialization process.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could lead to the fault observed in the test. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 27]\n}\n```"
