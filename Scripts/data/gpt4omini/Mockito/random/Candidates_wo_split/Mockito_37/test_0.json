    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldFailFastWhenCallingRealMethodOnInterface` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` which indicates that the test expected a certain behavior that did not occur. The test attempts to call a real method on a mocked interface, which is not allowed in Mockito, leading to a `MockitoException`.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious because they are involved in the mocking and stubbing process, which is where the failure is likely originating from:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress:getDebuggingInfo()`** - This method is related to the internal state of mocking and could provide insights into what went wrong during the mocking process.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.AnswersValidator:validate(...)`** - This method validates the answers provided to mocked methods, which is crucial when calling real methods on mocks.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:isVoid()`** - This method checks if the invocation is void, which is relevant when determining the behavior of the mocked method.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock(...)`** - This method is responsible for creating mocks, and any issues here could lead to the failure observed.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil:createMock(...)`** - This method creates the actual mock object and is critical in the mocking process.\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress:validateState()`** - This method validates the state of the mocking progress, which is essential to ensure that the mocking framework is in a valid state before proceeding with method calls.\n\nThese methods are interconnected in the mocking process and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9]\n}\n```"
