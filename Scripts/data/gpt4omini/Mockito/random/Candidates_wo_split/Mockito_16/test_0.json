    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldAllowStubbingMocksConfiguredWithRETURNS_MOCKS` is attempting to stub a method on a mock object using Mockito's `when()` method. However, it fails with a `MissingMethodInvocationException`, indicating that the argument passed to `when()` is not a valid method call on a mock.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `when()` method in the `org.mockito.Mockito` class, which is crucial for stubbing behavior in Mockito.\n\n3. The error message suggests that the issue may arise from trying to stub a method that is final, private, or one of the `equals()` or `hashCode()` methods, which cannot be stubbed or verified.\n\n4. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mocking, stubbing, and validation in the Mockito framework. The methods that are particularly relevant to the failure include:\n   - `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:when()`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.MockHandler:handle()`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor()`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:getSpiedInstance()`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.util.ObjectMethodsGuru:isEqualsMethod()`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.util.ObjectMethodsGuru:isHashCodeMethod()`\n\nThese methods are involved in the process of handling method calls on mocks and determining how to respond to them.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [30, 96, 97, 90, 78, 38]\n}\n``` \n\n- **30**: `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:when()`\n- **96**: `org.mockito.Mockito:mock()`\n- **97**: `org.mockito.internal.MockHandler:handle()`\n- **90**: `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:getSpiedInstance()`\n- **78**: `org.mockito.internal.util.ObjectMethodsGuru:isHashCodeMethod()`\n- **38**: `org.mockito.internal.util.ObjectMethodsGuru:isEqualsMethod()`\n\nThese methods are critical in the context of the failure and should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the issue."
