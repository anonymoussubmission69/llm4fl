If there is an issue in how it processes the invocation, it could lead to the UnsupportedOperationException.\n3. **InvocationMatcher.getMatchers** - This method retrieves the matchers associated with the invocation, which is essential for determining if the invocation matches the expected behavior.\n4. **MockingProgressImpl.stubbingCompleted** - This method marks the completion of stubbing, and if there are issues in the stubbing process, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n5. **MatchersBinder.bindMatchers** - This method binds the matchers to the invocation, and any issues here could lead to incorrect matching and subsequent failures.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 145, 69, 161, 183]\n}\n```"
