The error indicates that the type being mocked does not implement `Serializable`, which is crucial when using the `serializable()` setting.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockCreationValidator:validateSerializable(Ljava/lang/Class;Z)V`** - This method validates whether the class being mocked is serializable. The failure in the test suggests that this validation is not being met.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:validatedSettings(Ljava/lang/Class;Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/settings/CreationSettings;)Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/settings/CreationSettings;`** - This method is responsible for validating the settings for mock creation, including serialization settings.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock(Ljava/lang/Class;Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method is the core method for creating mocks, and it utilizes the settings validated by the previous methods.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer(Lorg/mockito/invocation/InvocationOnMock;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method is involved in providing deep stubs, which may also be affected by the serialization settings.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method handles the invocation of mocks and may be impacted by the serialization issue.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.NullResultGuardian:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method is responsible for handling invocations and may also be affected by the serialization settings.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 110, 33, 4, 5, 68, 114]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
