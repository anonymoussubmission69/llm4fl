The stack trace indicates that a `MockitoException` is thrown, which suggests that there is an issue with the mocking process, particularly related to the constructor of the class being mocked.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock`** - This method is responsible for creating mocks. If there is an issue with the parameters being passed (like a problematic class type), it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n   \n2. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:process`** - This method processes annotations for the test class. If it encounters an issue with the `@Spy` annotation, it could lead to the failure.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.SpyAnnotationEngine:process`** - This method specifically handles the `@Spy` annotation. If the constructor of the class being spied on is problematic, it could cause the exception.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:useConstructor`** - This method is related to using constructors when creating mocks. If the constructor is not valid or throws an exception, it could lead to the failure.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil:isTypeMockable`** - This method checks if a type can be mocked. If the type is not mockable (e.g., if it's a final class or a primitive), it could lead to issues during mocking.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.LenientCopyTool:copy`** - This method is involved in copying values from one object to another. If it encounters issues with the fields being copied, it could lead to exceptions.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:injectMocks`** - This method is responsible for injecting mocks into the test class. If it fails to inject a mock properly, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 28, 21, 2, 60, 92]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
