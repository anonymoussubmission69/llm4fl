    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testCallsRealInterfaceMethod` is attempting to call a real method on a mock of an interface (`List<String>`). However, the error message indicates that calling real methods is only possible when mocking non-abstract methods. This suggests that the mock is not set up correctly for the intended operation.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `CallsRealMethods.answer` method, which is responsible for handling calls to real methods on mocks. The error is triggered when it tries to call a real method on an abstract class or interface.\n\n3. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods related to mock creation and invocation handling. The most relevant methods to investigate further are those that deal with mock settings, invocation handling, and the specific method that attempts to call the real method.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n- `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods:answer(Lorg/mockito/invocation/InvocationOnMock;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 68)\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:callRealMethod()Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 135)\n- `org.mockito.internal.creation.settings.CreationSettings:getTypeToMock()Ljava/lang/Class;` (method_id: 106)\n- `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:defaultAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;` (method_id: 110)\n- `org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 156)\n\nThese methods are directly related to the mock's behavior and the invocation of real methods, which is where the failure occurs.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [68, 135, 106, 110, 156]\n}\n```"
