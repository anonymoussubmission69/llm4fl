"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is designed to check that invoking `Mockito.after()` with a negative value throws a `FriendlyReminderException`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when the test attempts to invoke `Mockito.after(-1)`, which suggests that the method responsible for handling this negative value is likely where the fault lies.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.Mockito:after(J)Lorg/mockito/verification/VerificationAfterDelay;`** - This method is directly invoked in the test and is responsible for creating a `VerificationAfterDelay` object. It takes a long value as an argument, which is where the negative value is passed.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.Times:<init>(I)V`** - This constructor checks if the number of invocations is negative. If the `after` method does not handle the negative value properly, it could lead to this constructor being invoked with an invalid argument.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationOverTimeImpl:<init>(JJLorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;ZLorg/mockito/internal/util/Timer;)V`** - This method is part of the verification process and may be indirectly affected by the negative duration passed to the `after` method.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationModeFactory:times(I)Lorg/mockito/internal/verification/Times;`** - This method creates a `Times` object, which could also be involved in the verification process and may be affected by the negative value.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.verification.After:<init>(JJLorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;)V`** - This constructor is called as part of the verification process and may also be impacted by the negative duration.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 4, 6, 5, 0]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to determine how they handle negative values and whether they contribute to the failure observed in the test."
