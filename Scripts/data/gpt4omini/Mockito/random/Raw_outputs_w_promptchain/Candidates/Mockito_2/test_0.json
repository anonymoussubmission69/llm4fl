"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `should_throw_friendly_reminder_exception_when_duration_is_negative` is designed to check that a `Timer` cannot be created with a negative duration. The test fails when it attempts to create a `Timer` with a negative value, which should throw a `FriendlyReminderException`. \n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure occurs at the point where the `Timer` constructor is invoked. Therefore, the constructor of the `Timer` class is a primary suspect. \n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are relevant:\n\n1. **Timer Constructor**: `org.mockito.internal.util.Timer:<init>(J)V` - This method is directly related to the creation of the `Timer` object and is the most likely source of the fault since the test is specifically checking for the behavior of this constructor when given a negative duration.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is the `Timer` constructor.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [13]  // The potential suspicious method's id\n}\n```"
