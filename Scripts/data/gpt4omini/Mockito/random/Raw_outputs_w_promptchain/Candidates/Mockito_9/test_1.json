"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is failing due to an attempt to call a real method on an abstract class (`AbstractThing`). The error message indicates that calling real methods is only possible when mocking non-abstract methods.\n2. The stack trace points to the `cannotCallAbstractRealMethod` method in the `MockitoException` class, which suggests that the issue arises from the mocking setup in the test.\n3. The test method `abstractMethodStubbed` is trying to assert the result of `thing.fullName()`, which likely relies on the `name()` method of the `AbstractThing` class.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 62**: `org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:cannotCallAbstractRealMethod()`\n- **Method ID 69**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods:answer(Lorg/mockito/invocation/InvocationOnMock;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n- **Method ID 138**: `org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:reportOngoingStubbing(Lorg/mockito/internal/progress/IOngoingStubbing;)V`\n- **Method ID 139**: `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:callRealMethod()Ljava/lang/Object;`\n- **Method ID 144**: `org.mockito.Mockito:spy(Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n\nThese methods are related to the mocking framework's handling of method calls, particularly with respect to abstract methods and the invocation of real methods on mocks.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [62, 69, 138, 139, 144]\n}\n```"
