"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:callRealMethod()`** (method_id: 144)\n   - This method is directly involved in calling the real method on a mock. The stack trace indicates that it attempts to call an abstract method, which is not allowed.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:cannotCallAbstractRealMethod()`** (method_id: 65)\n   - This method is responsible for reporting the error when an attempt is made to call an abstract method. It is crucial to investigate how this method is triggered.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods:answer()`** (method_id: 72)\n   - This method is responsible for handling the invocation of real methods on mocks. It is essential to check how it interacts with the `callRealMethod()`.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle()`** (method_id: 165)\n   - This method handles the invocation and may be involved in the flow that leads to the error. It is important to analyze how it processes invocations.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:getSpiedInstance()`** (method_id: 67)\n   - This method retrieves the spied instance, which is relevant since the test is using a spy on an abstract class.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.settings.CreationSettings:isUsingConstructor()`** (method_id: 105)\n   - This method checks if a constructor is being used, which may be relevant in the context of mocking and spying.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.cglib.ClassImposterizer:imposterise()`** (method_id: 95)\n   - This method is responsible for creating a proxy for the mocked type. It is important to analyze how it handles abstract classes.\n\n8. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.cglib.ClassImposterizer:createProxy()`** (method_id: 123)\n   - This method creates a proxy for the class being mocked. It is essential to check how it deals with abstract classes.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [144, 65, 72, 165, 67, 105, 95, 123]\n}\n```"
