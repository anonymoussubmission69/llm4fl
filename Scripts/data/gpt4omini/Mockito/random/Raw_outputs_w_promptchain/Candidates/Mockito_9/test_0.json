"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testCallsRealInterfaceMethod` is attempting to call a real method on a mocked interface (`List<String>`). The error message indicates that calling real methods is only possible when mocking non-abstract methods. This suggests that the mock setup is incorrect.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `CallsRealMethods.answer` method, which is responsible for handling calls to real methods on mocks. The error occurs because the method being called is abstract, which is not allowed.\n\n3. The suspicious methods that need to be analyzed include:\n   - `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods:answer` (method_id: 68) - This method is directly involved in the error.\n   - `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:callRealMethod` (method_id: 135) - This method is responsible for invoking the real method on the mock.\n   - `org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle` (method_id: 156) - This method handles the invocation and may be involved in the error propagation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [68, 135, 156]\n}\n```"
