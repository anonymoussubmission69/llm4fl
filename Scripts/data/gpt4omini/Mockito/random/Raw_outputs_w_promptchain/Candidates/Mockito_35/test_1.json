"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldNotThrowNPEWhenIntPassed` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` at line 38, which indicates that the method `mock.intArgumentMethod(100)` is likely involved in the failure. The stack trace suggests that the issue arises when verifying the mock's behavior.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the Mockito framework, which are responsible for mocking and verifying behavior. The following methods are particularly suspicious as they are related to the mocking process and could potentially lead to the `NullPointerException`:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:getMethod()`** - This method retrieves the method being invoked on the mock. If the method is not properly set up, it could lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:isVoid()`** - This method checks if the invocation is void. If the invocation is not set up correctly, it could also lead to issues.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/util/List;)`** - This constructor initializes an invocation matcher. If the invocation is null or improperly set, it could lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:argumentsToMatchers()`** - This method converts arguments to matchers. If the arguments are not properly handled, it could lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:validateState()`** - This method validates the state of mocking progress. If the state is invalid, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nThese methods are interconnected in the mocking process and could propagate the fault leading to the `NullPointerException`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 1, 81, 61, 108]\n}\n```"
