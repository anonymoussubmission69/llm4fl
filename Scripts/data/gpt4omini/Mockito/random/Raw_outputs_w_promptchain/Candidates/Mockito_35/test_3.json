"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldNotThrowNPEWhenIntegerPassedToEq` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` at line 45, which is related to the verification of a mocked method call. The method `intArgumentMethod` is being verified with an argument matcher `eq(new Integer(100))`.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **CGLIBProxyRealMethod**: This method is involved in creating proxies for mocked objects, which could be related to how the mock is set up.\n2. **Invocation**: This class is responsible for handling method invocations on mocks, and since the test is failing during a verification step, it is crucial to analyze how invocations are processed.\n3. **MatchersBinder**: This class binds matchers to invocations, and since the test uses an argument matcher, it is important to check if the matchers are being handled correctly.\n4. **MockHandler**: This class handles the invocation of mocked methods and could be responsible for the `NullPointerException` if it is not managing the invocation correctly.\n5. **MockUtil**: This utility class checks if an object is a mock, which is relevant since the test is verifying a mocked method.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 66, 92, 105]\n}\n```"
