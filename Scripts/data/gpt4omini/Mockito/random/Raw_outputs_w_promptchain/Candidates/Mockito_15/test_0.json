"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldInjectUsingPropertySetterIfAvailable` failed due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected condition `awaitingInjection.propertySetterUsed` was not met. This suggests that there may be an issue with the injection process, particularly with how property setters are being utilized.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods related to mock injection and field initialization. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine:injectMocksOnFields`** (method_id: 19) - This method is responsible for injecting mocks into fields, which is central to the test's purpose.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldInitializer:initialize`** (method_id: 69) - This method initializes fields, which may be related to the property setter not being used correctly.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:injectMocks`** (method_id: 97) - This method handles the overall injection process, which is crucial for the test's success.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldSetter:set`** (method_id: 23) - This method sets the value of a field, which is directly related to the property setter functionality.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:process`** (method_id: 9) - This method processes annotations, which may affect how mocks are injected based on annotations like `@InjectMocks`.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and play a significant role in the mock injection process, which is the focus of the failing test. Analyzing these methods will help identify the root cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [19, 69, 97, 23, 9]\n}\n```"
