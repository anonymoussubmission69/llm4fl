"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/util/List;)V`** - This method is involved in creating an `InvocationMatcher`, which is crucial for matching method calls to their expected behavior. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurred while capturing arguments, which suggests that there might be an issue with how the invocation is being matched.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation of mocked methods. Since the exception is thrown during the handling of a method call, this method is critical to investigate.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)V`** - This method adds an answer to the invocation container. If there is an issue with how answers are being added or retrieved, it could lead to unexpected behavior during method invocation.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Lorg/mockito/internal/stubbing/StubbedInvocationMatcher;`** - This method is responsible for finding the appropriate answer for a given invocation. If it fails to find the correct answer, it could lead to the `UnsupportedOperationException` being thrown.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:stubbingCompleted(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)V`** - This method marks the completion of stubbing. If there is an issue with the stubbing process, it could affect subsequent invocations.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.OngoingStubbingImpl:thenAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;`** - This method is used to define the behavior of a stubbed method. If the answer provided is not valid, it could lead to exceptions during invocation.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.OngoingStubbingImpl:thenReturn(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;`** - Similar to `thenAnswer`, this method defines the return value for a stubbed method. Issues here could also lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 136, 161, 30, 152, 148, 137]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
