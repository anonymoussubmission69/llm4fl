"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** (method_id: 0): This method is involved in capturing arguments from the invocation, which is critical in the mocking framework. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` occurred here, suggesting that there might be an issue with how arguments are being handled.\n\n2. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** (method_id: 140): This method is responsible for handling the invocation and returning the appropriate response. Since the error occurred during the invocation handling, this method is crucial to investigate.\n\n3. **InvocationContainerImpl.addAnswer** (method_id: 193): This method adds an answer to the invocation container. If there is an issue with how answers are being added or processed, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n4. **ArgumentsProcessor.argumentsToMatchers** (method_id: 176): This method converts arguments to matchers. If the arguments are not being processed correctly, it could lead to mismatches during invocation, resulting in the failure.\n\n5. **MockingProgressImpl.stubbingStarted** (method_id: 74): This method is called to indicate that stubbing has started. If there is an issue with the stubbing process, it could affect the overall behavior of the mock.\n\n6. **MockingProgressImpl.validateState** (method_id: 195): This method validates the state of the mocking progress. If the state is not valid, it could lead to unexpected behavior during the test execution.\n\n7. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** (method_id: 160): This method is responsible for notifying method calls and handling exceptions. If there is an issue in this method, it could propagate errors during the invocation handling.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 140, 193, 176, 74, 195, 160]\n}\n```"
