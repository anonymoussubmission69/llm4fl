"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Z` (Method ID: 197)** - This method is involved in matching invocations, which is critical in determining if the correct mock behavior is being applied. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` occurred during the invocation matching process.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (Method ID: 148)** - This method handles the invocation of mocks and is responsible for returning the appropriate response based on the stubbing. The failure in the test suggests that there might be an issue in how the invocation is being processed.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Lorg/mockito/internal/stubbing/StubbedInvocationMatcher;` (Method ID: 34)** - This method is responsible for finding the appropriate answer for a given invocation. If it fails to find the correct answer, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the mock.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)V` (Method ID: 198)** - This method adds an answer to the invocation container. If there is an issue with how answers are being added or retrieved, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:resetInvocationForPotentialStubbing(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;)V` (Method ID: 68)** - This method resets the invocation for potential stubbing. If the reset logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect stubbing behavior.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:stubbingCompleted(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)V` (Method ID: 162)** - This method marks the completion of stubbing. If there is an issue in this process, it could affect the overall mocking behavior.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:validateState()V` (Method ID: 200)** - This method validates the state of the mocking progress. If the state is not valid, it could lead to unexpected behavior during the test execution.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [197, 148, 34, 198, 68, 162, 200]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
