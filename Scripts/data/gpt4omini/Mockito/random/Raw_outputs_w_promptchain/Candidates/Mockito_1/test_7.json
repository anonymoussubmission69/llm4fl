"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom(Invocation)`** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. It is crucial to analyze why this exception is thrown, especially since it is related to capturing arguments from an invocation.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(Invocation)`** - This method is responsible for handling invocations and may be involved in the propagation of the exception. It is essential to check how it interacts with the `InvocationMatcher`.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.ThrowsException:answer(InvocationOnMock)`** - This method is related to throwing exceptions during stubbing. Since the test involves stubbing and throwing a `RuntimeException`, it is important to analyze how this method is functioning.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:setInvocationForPotentialStubbing(InvocationMatcher)`** - This method sets the invocation for potential stubbing and may be involved in the process leading to the exception.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor(Invocation)`** - This method finds the answer for a given invocation and could be relevant in understanding how the invocation is being processed.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:stubbingCompleted(Invocation)`** - This method indicates the completion of stubbing and may provide insights into the state of the mocking progress when the exception occurs.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer(Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;)`** - This method adds an answer to the invocation container and could be relevant in understanding how answers are being processed.\n\n8. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:hasInvocationForPotentialStubbing()`** - This method checks if there are any invocations for potential stubbing, which may be relevant to the test's context.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [49, 142, 87, 63, 32, 72, 199, 191]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the stack trace and their potential role in the propagation of the exception. Further investigation into these methods is necessary to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
