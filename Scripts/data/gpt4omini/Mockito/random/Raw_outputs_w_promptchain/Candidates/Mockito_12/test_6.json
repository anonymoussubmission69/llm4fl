"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `shouldLookForAnnotatedCaptorsInSuperClasses` is attempting to initialize mocks using `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(sub)`. This indicates that the test is relying on Mockito's annotation processing to create mock objects.\n\n2. The stack trace reveals a `ClassCastException` occurring in the `GenericMaster.getGenericType` method, which is called during the annotation processing. This suggests that there is an issue with type casting related to generics.\n\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace and the covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the Mockito framework, particularly those related to annotation processing and generic type handling.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMaster:getGenericType`** - This method is directly involved in the exception and deals with generic types.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:processAnnotationOn`** - This method processes annotations and may be involved in the creation of mocks.\n3. **`org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations:initMocks`** - This method initializes mocks and is the entry point for the test.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:createMockFor`** - This method creates mocks for the annotations and may be related to the failure.\n5. **`org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations:processAnnotationDeprecatedWay`** - This method processes annotations in a deprecated way and may also be relevant.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe methods listed above are likely to be the source of the fault due to their involvement in the mock initialization process and the handling of generics, which is where the exception is being thrown.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [11, 5, 4, 3, 7]\n}\n```"
