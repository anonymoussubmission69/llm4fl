"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldScreamWhenWrongTypeForCaptor` is designed to check the behavior of the `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks` method when it encounters a wrong type for a captor. The stack trace indicates that a `ClassCastException` is thrown, specifically when trying to cast a `ParameterizedTypeImpl` to a `Class`.\n\n2. The exception is propagated through several methods, primarily within the `MockitoAnnotations` and `DefaultAnnotationEngine` classes, which are responsible for processing annotations and creating mocks.\n\n3. The methods that are directly involved in the exception and are covered by the failed test include:\n   - `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMaster:getGenericType`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:processAnnotationOn`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:createMockFor`\n   - `org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations:initMocks`\n   - `org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations:processAnnotationDeprecatedWay`\n\nThese methods are suspicious because they are part of the call stack leading to the exception, and they handle the creation and processing of mocks, which is the core functionality being tested.\n\nNow, I will summarize the findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 5, 3, 7, 11]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method IDs**:\n  - `4`: `org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations:initMocks`\n  - `5`: `org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:processAnnotationOn`\n  - `3`: `org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:createMockFor`\n  - `7`: `org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations:processAnnotationDeprecatedWay`\n  - `11`: `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMaster:getGenericType`\n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the `ClassCastException`."
