"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:callRealMethod()`** - This method is directly involved in calling the real method on a mock object, which is where the `NoSuchMethodError` is being thrown. This indicates that the method being called does not exist, which is a critical point of failure.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke()`** - This method is responsible for invoking the real method on the target object. Since the error is related to method invocation, this method is also crucial to investigate.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:getDefaultAnswer()`** - This method retrieves the default answer for a mock, which could influence how methods are stubbed and invoked.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.StubbedInvocationMatcher:answer()`** - This method is responsible for providing the answer to a stubbed invocation, which could also be related to how the mock behaves when a method is called.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.MockitoStubber:findAnswerFor()`** - This method finds the appropriate answer for a given invocation, which is essential in determining how the mock responds to method calls.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:getMethod()`** - This method retrieves the method associated with the invocation, which is important for understanding what method is being called and why it might not exist.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:isVoid()`** - This method checks if the invocation is for a void method, which could affect how the invocation is handled.\n\n8. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches()`** - This method checks if the invocation matches a certain criteria, which is relevant in the context of method invocation and stubbing.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 4, 30, 42, 54, 26, 2, 108]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the invocation process and their potential to propagate the fault observed in the test failure."
