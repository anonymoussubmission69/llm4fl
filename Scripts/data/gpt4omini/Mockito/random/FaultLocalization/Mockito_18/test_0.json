This suggests that the method being tested is returning `null` when it should be returning an empty iterable. The method `returnValueFor` is responsible for returning values based on the type provided, and it appears to return `null` for certain types, which could lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method returnValueFor is responsible for returning values based on the type.
