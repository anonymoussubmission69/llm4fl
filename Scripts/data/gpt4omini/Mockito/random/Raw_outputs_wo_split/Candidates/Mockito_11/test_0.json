"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `equals_should_return_true_when_equal` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` when asserting that two `DelegatingMethod` instances are equal. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `equals` method of the `DelegatingMethod` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mocking and injection strategies, but the most relevant method to investigate is the `equals` method of the `DelegatingMethod` class, as it directly relates to the failure.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:equals(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z`** - This method is directly involved in the failure since the test is asserting the equality of two `DelegatingMethod` instances.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:<init>(Ljava/lang/reflect/Method;)V`** - The constructor initializes the `DelegatingMethod` instance, and any issues in the initialization could affect the equality check.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.util.collections.HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet:of(Ljava/lang/Iterable;)Lorg/mockito/internal/util/collections/HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet;`** - This method is related to the creation of a set that may involve the `DelegatingMethod` instances, and its behavior could impact the equality checks.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.util.collections.HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet:addAll(Ljava/util/Collection;)Z`** - Similar to the previous method, this method adds elements to a collection and could be relevant if the collection is involved in the equality check.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.util.collections.HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet:iterator()Ljava/util/Iterator;`** - The iterator method may also be relevant if the equality check involves iterating over a collection of `DelegatingMethod` instances.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [38, 57, 0, 31, 37]\n}\n``` \n\nThis JSON object lists the method IDs that are potentially suspicious and need further investigation to identify the root cause of the test failure."
