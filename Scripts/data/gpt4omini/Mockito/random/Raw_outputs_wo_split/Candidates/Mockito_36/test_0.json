"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`callRealMethod()`** (method_id: 3): This method is directly involved in invoking the real method on a mock object. The stack trace indicates that the error occurred while trying to call a real method on an interface, which is not allowed.\n\n2. **`invokeSuper()`** (method_id: 4): This method is responsible for invoking the super method in the context of CGLIB proxies. Since the error is related to method invocation, this method could be involved in the propagation of the fault.\n\n3. **`invoke()`** (method_id: 43): This method is part of the `FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod` class and is responsible for invoking the real method. It is directly related to the error that occurred.\n\n4. **`validate()`** (method_id: 1): This method validates the answer provided to the invocation. If the answer is not valid, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n5. **`get()`** (method_id: 22): This method retrieves the default answer for the mock. If the default answer is not set correctly, it could lead to the invocation of a non-existent method.\n\n6. **`mock()`** (method_id: 85): This method is responsible for creating a mock object. If the mock is not set up correctly, it could lead to the invocation of methods that do not exist.\n\n7. **`when()`** (method_id: 30): This method is used to set up stubbing for the mock. If the stubbing is not set up correctly, it could lead to the invocation of methods that do not exist.\n\n8. **`getDebuggingInfo()`** (method_id: 65): This method retrieves debugging information. If there is an issue with the mocking progress, it could lead to the invocation of methods that do not exist.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 4, 43, 1, 22, 85, 30, 65]\n}\n```"
