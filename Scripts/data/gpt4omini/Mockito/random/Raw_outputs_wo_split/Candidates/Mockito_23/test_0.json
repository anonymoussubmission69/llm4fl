"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is attempting to serialize and deserialize a mock object created using Mockito's `mock` method with deep stubs. The failure occurs due to a `NotSerializableException` for an internal class of Mockito (`ReturnsDeepStubs$2`), indicating that the mock object is not serializable.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the exception is thrown during the serialization process, specifically in the `SimpleSerializationUtil.serializeAndBack` method, which is responsible for serializing the mock object.\n\n3. The methods involved in the serialization process and the creation of the mock object are critical to investigate. This includes methods related to mock creation, serialization settings, and the handling of deep stubs.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock` (method_id: 1) - This method is responsible for creating the mock object.\n- `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:serializable` (method_id: 66) - This method sets the mock to be serializable.\n- `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:getMock` (method_id: 22) - This method is related to handling deep stubs, which is directly involved in the serialization process.\n- `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer` (method_id: 95) - This method is part of the deep stubs implementation and may affect serialization.\n- `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:recordDeepStubMock` (method_id: 53) - This method records the deep stub mock, which is relevant to the serialization issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 22, 53, 66, 95]\n}\n```"
