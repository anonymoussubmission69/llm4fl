"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `should_capture_all_vararg` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output is a list containing the strings `[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"again ?!\"]`, while the actual output is `[42, 42]`. This indicates that the method responsible for capturing the arguments is not functioning correctly.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `Assertions.assertThat(argumentCaptor.getAllValues()).containsExactly(...)` line, which suggests that the issue lies in how the arguments are being captured and returned by the `ArgumentCaptor`.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include various methods related to argument capturing and verification, particularly those that deal with `InvocationMatcher`, `ArgumentCaptor`, and the verification process.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze\nBased on the above reasoning, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom(...)`** (method_id: 44): This method is responsible for capturing arguments from an invocation, which is directly related to the failure in capturing the expected values.\n\n- **`org.mockito.ArgumentCaptor:getAllValues()`** (method_id: 130): This method retrieves all captured values, and since the test is failing at the assertion of these values, it is crucial to check its implementation.\n\n- **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.ArgumentsProcessor:argumentsToMatchers(...)`** (method_id: 198): This method processes arguments into matchers, which may affect how arguments are captured and matched.\n\n- **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.ArgumentsComparator:argumentsMatch(...)`** (method_id: 187): This method compares the arguments of invocations, which could be relevant in determining why the expected and actual values do not match.\n\n- **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor(...)`** (method_id: 26): This method finds the answer for a given invocation, which may be involved in how the mock responds to the captured arguments.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods identified for further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [44, 130, 198, 187, 26]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are likely to contain the fault or contribute to the issue observed in the failing test."
