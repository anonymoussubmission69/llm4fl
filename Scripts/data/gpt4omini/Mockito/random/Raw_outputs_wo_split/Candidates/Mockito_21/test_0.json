"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `creates_instances_of_inner_classes` is failing due to an `InstantationException` which indicates that the system is unable to create a mock instance of `SomeInnerClass`. This suggests that there might be an issue with how inner classes are being instantiated, particularly in relation to their outer class instances.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `ConstructorInstantiator` class, specifically the `newInstance` method, which is responsible for creating instances of classes. The error message indicates that the outer class instance might not be correctly set, leading to the failure.\n\n3. The methods that are covered by the failed test include several methods related to mocking and injection, but the most relevant ones are those that deal with instantiation and constructor handling.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n- **ConstructorInstantiator:newInstance** (method_id: 14): This method is directly involved in creating instances and is likely where the failure is occurring.\n- **ConstructorInstantiator:withOuterClass** (method_id: 46): This method is responsible for handling the instantiation of inner classes with their outer class instances, which is crucial for the test that is failing.\n- **ConstructorInstantiator:paramsException** (method_id: 41): This method is used to create exceptions related to instantiation issues, which might provide insights into the failure.\n- **ConstructorInstantiator:<init>** (method_id: 35): The constructor of the `ConstructorInstantiator` itself may also be relevant as it initializes the outer class instance.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 46, 41, 35]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
