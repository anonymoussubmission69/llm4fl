"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `will_return_default_value_on_non_mockable_nested_generic` is failing due to a `ClassCastException`. This indicates that there is an issue with type casting, likely related to the mocking framework being used (Mockito in this case).\n\n2. The stack trace points to a specific line in the test where the failure occurs, which is related to the method `returningNonMockableNestedGeneric()` of the `GenericsNest` class. This suggests that the method is involved in the failure.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the Mockito framework, particularly those related to mocking and handling invocations. The methods that are most relevant to the failure include those that deal with deep stubs and mock creation.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n- **Method ID 0**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:getMock(...)` - This method is responsible for retrieving the mock object, which is crucial in the context of deep stubbing.\n- **Method ID 2**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs$1:recordDeepStubMock(...)` - This method records the deep stub mock, which is directly related to the failure.\n- **Method ID 75**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer(...)` - This method handles the answer for the invocation, which could be where the type mismatch occurs.\n- **Method ID 54**: `org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerFactory:create(...)` - This method creates the mock handler, which is essential for managing the mock's behavior.\n- **Method ID 3**: `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock(...)` - This method is responsible for creating the mock itself, which is fundamental to the test's setup.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe methods listed above are critical to the mocking process and are likely candidates for further investigation to identify the root cause of the `ClassCastException`. The issue may stem from incorrect type handling or configuration in the mocking setup.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3, 54, 75]\n}\n```"
