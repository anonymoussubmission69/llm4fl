"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `can_create_mock_from_return_types_declared_with_a_bounded_wildcard` is failing due to a `ClassCastException`. This indicates that there is an issue with type casting, specifically when trying to cast an object to `Number`.\n\n2. The stack trace points to line 80 in the test method, which involves the method `mock.returningWildcard()`. This suggests that the method `returningWildcard()` is likely returning an object that cannot be cast to `Number`.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mocking and handling invocations, particularly in the `ReturnsDeepStubs` class, which is responsible for returning deep stubs for mocked objects.\n\n4. The methods that are most relevant to the failure are those that deal with the creation and handling of mocks, as well as the methods that are involved in returning values from these mocks.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be investigated further:\n\n- `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:getMock(...)` (method_id: 0)\n- `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer(...)` (method_id: 83)\n- `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:recordDeepStubMock(...)` (method_id: 96)\n- `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:defaultAnswer(...)` (method_id: 101)\n- `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:getSpiedInstance(...)` (method_id: 60)\n- `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:getTypeToMock(...)` (method_id: 94)\n\nThese methods are involved in the mocking process and may be responsible for the incorrect type being returned, leading to the `ClassCastException`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 83, 96, 101, 60, 94]\n}\n```"
