"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is failing because the `reportInvocation` method of the `invocationListener` was expected to be called but was not invoked. This indicates that there might be an issue with the mocking or the invocation of the method that should trigger this call.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the line in the test where the verification is done, which is line 23 in the test method. This suggests that the methods involved in the mocking and invocation process are critical to investigate.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include various methods related to mocking, invocation handling, and verification. The methods that are particularly relevant to the failure are those that deal with the invocation of the mocked object and the reporting of that invocation.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n- **Method ID 0**: `org.mockito.internal.debugging.Location:toString()`\n- **Method ID 1**: `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:getMethod()`\n- **Method ID 2**: `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock()`\n- **Method ID 3**: `org.mockito.internal.util.Primitives:isPrimitiveWrapper()`\n- **Method ID 4**: `org.mockito.internal.MockHandler:<init>()`\n- **Method ID 14**: `org.mockito.internal.InvocationNotifierHandler:<init>()`\n- **Method ID 23**: `org.mockito.internal.InvocationNotifierHandler:notifyMethodCallException()`\n- **Method ID 42**: `org.mockito.internal.verification.Times:verify()`\n- **Method ID 78**: `org.mockito.internal.verification.checkers.MissingInvocationChecker:check()`\n- **Method ID 151**: `org.mockito.internal.MockHandler:handle()`\n\nThese methods are involved in the mocking framework's core functionality, including how mocks are created, how invocations are handled, and how verification is performed. Any issues in these methods could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods identified for further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 23, 42, 78, 151]\n}\n```"
