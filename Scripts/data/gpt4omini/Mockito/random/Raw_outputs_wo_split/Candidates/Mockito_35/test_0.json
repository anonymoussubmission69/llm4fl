"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldNotThrowNPEWhenIntegerPassed` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` at line 31, which indicates that the method `intArgumentMethod` is being called on a mock object that is not properly initialized or is null.\n\nThe stack trace suggests that the issue arises when verifying the interaction with the mock object. The test is trying to verify that `intArgumentMethod` was called with an `Integer` argument, but it seems that the mock object might not be set up correctly.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the mocking and verification process:\n\n1. `org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod:<init>(Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/MockitoMethodProxy;)V` - This method is related to the creation of the proxy for the mock object.\n2. `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:getMethod()Ljava/lang/reflect/Method;` - This method retrieves the method being invoked on the mock.\n3. `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock(Ljava/lang/Class;Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;)Ljava/lang/Object;` - This method is responsible for creating the mock object.\n4. `org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil:createMock(Ljava/lang/Class;Lorg/mockito/internal/progress/MockingProgress;Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/MockSettingsImpl;)Ljava/lang/Object;` - This method creates the mock instance.\n5. `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsEmptyValues:returnValueFor(Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/Object;` - This method handles the return values for mocked methods.\n6. `org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress:validateState()V` - This method validates the state of the mocking progress.\n7. `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:argumentsToMatchers()Ljava/util/List;` - This method converts arguments to matchers for verification.\n\nThese methods are critical in the mocking framework and their failure to operate correctly could lead to the `NullPointerException` observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 61]\n}\n```"
