"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `can_create_mock_with_constructor` is failing because the expected message \"hey!\" is not being returned, but instead, `null` is being returned. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the mock object not being properly initialized or the constructor not being called correctly.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/util/List;)V`** - This method is responsible for creating an `InvocationMatcher`, which is crucial for matching method calls on mocks.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock(Ljava/lang/Class;Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method is responsible for creating the mock object. If there is an issue here, it could lead to the mock not being set up correctly.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:validatedSettings(Ljava/lang/Class;Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/settings/CreationSettings;)Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/settings/CreationSettings;`** - This method validates the settings used to create the mock. If the settings are incorrect, it could lead to the mock not behaving as expected.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:useConstructor()Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;`** - This method indicates whether the constructor should be used for creating the mock. If this is not set correctly, it could lead to the mock not being initialized properly.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Lorg/mockito/internal/stubbing/StubbedInvocationMatcher;`** - This method is responsible for finding the answer for a given invocation. If it cannot find the correct answer, it may return `null`, leading to the failure observed in the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 6, 28, 52]\n}\n```"
