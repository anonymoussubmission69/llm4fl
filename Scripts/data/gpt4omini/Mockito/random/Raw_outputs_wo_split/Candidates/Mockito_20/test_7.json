"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `exception_message_when_constructor_not_found` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` which indicates that the expected behavior of the test is not being met. The test is trying to create a spy of `HasConstructor.class`, but it seems that the constructor is not found, leading to the failure.\n\nThe stack trace points to the `mock` method in the `MockitoCore` class as the entry point where the failure occurs. This method is responsible for creating mocks and is likely where the issue originates. \n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mock creation and validation. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`mock`** - This method is responsible for creating a mock object. If the constructor is not found, it could be due to issues in this method.\n2. **`validatedSettings`** - This method validates the settings for mock creation, including checking if the constructor can be used.\n3. **`validateConstructorUse`** - This method specifically checks if the constructor is being used correctly, which is directly related to the test failure.\n4. **`isUsingConstructor`** - This method checks if the mock settings indicate that a constructor is being used, which is relevant to the test case.\n5. **`createMock`** - This method is responsible for creating the actual mock instance, and any issues here could lead to the constructor not being found.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 4, 41, 82, 20]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to determine the root cause of the test failure."
