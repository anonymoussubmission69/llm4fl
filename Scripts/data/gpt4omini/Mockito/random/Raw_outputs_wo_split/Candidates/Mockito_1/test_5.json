"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/util/List;)V`** - This constructor is responsible for creating an `InvocationMatcher` which is crucial for matching invocations. If there is an issue with how arguments are processed or matched, it could lead to the `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.checkers.NumberOfInvocationsChecker:check(Ljava/util/List;Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;I)V`** - This method checks the number of invocations against the expected count. If the invocation matcher is not set up correctly, it could lead to verification failures.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.Times:verify(Lorg/mockito/internal/verification/api/VerificationData;)V`** - This method is responsible for verifying the number of times a method was invoked. If the verification mode is not set correctly, it could lead to exceptions during verification.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Z`** - This method checks if a given invocation matches the expected invocation. If there is an issue with how the matchers are set up, it could lead to incorrect verification results.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.ArgumentsProcessor:argumentsToMatchers([Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/util/List;`** - This method processes the arguments to matchers. If the arguments are not processed correctly, it could lead to mismatches during verification.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method handles the invocation and could throw exceptions if the invocation is not handled properly.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:verificationStarted(Lorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;)V`** - This method starts the verification process and could lead to issues if the mocking progress is not in a valid state.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 151, 47, 212, 189, 155, 219]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the verification process and any issues within them could lead to the observed failure in the test."
