"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType:extractRawTypeOf`** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace as throwing an exception related to raw extraction not being supported. It is crucial to analyze this method as it is likely the source of the error.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer`** - This method is involved in handling the deep stubbing mechanism, which is relevant to the test case that is failing. It may be propagating the issue related to the raw type extraction.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:validatedSettings`** - This method validates the settings for mock creation and could be involved in the configuration that leads to the error.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:prepareExtraInterfaces`** - This method prepares extra interfaces for the mock settings and could be related to the type handling that is causing the issue.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil:isTypeMockable`** - This method checks if a type is mockable, which is relevant to the mocking framework's ability to handle the types involved in the test.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:recordDeepStubAnswer`** - This method records the deep stub answer and could be involved in the propagation of the error.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>`** - This constructor initializes the invocation matcher, which is essential for the mocking framework's operation and could be related to the invocation that leads to the error.\n\n8. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:getMethod`** - This method retrieves the method being invoked, which is critical in understanding what is being mocked and could be related to the error.\n\n9. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle`** - This method handles the invocation and could be involved in the error propagation.\n\n10. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.NullResultGuardian:handle`** - This method is responsible for handling null results, which could be relevant in the context of the error.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [41, 21, 6, 3, 5, 9, 1, 39, 128, 66]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test case."
