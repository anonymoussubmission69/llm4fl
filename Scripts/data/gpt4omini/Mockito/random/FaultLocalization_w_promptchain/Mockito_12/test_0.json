The stack trace indicates that the error occurs when trying to cast a `ParameterizedTypeImpl` to a `Class`, which suggests that the methods involved in processing annotations and creating mocks are likely to be the source of the problem.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method attempts to retrieve the generic type of a field.
