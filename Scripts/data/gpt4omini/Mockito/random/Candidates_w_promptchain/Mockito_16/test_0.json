    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldAllowStubbingMocksConfiguredWithRETURNS_MOCKS` is attempting to stub a method on a mock object using Mockito's `when()` method. However, it fails with a `MissingMethodInvocationException`, indicating that the argument passed to `when()` is not a valid method call on a mock.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `when()` method in the `org.mockito.Mockito` class, which is crucial for stubbing behavior in Mockito. The error suggests that the method being stubbed may not be properly set up as a mock or that the method being called is not a valid mock method.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mocking and stubbing in Mockito, such as `mock()`, `when()`, and various internal methods that handle invocation and stubbing.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;` (method_id: 30)\n- `org.mockito.Mockito:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;` (method_id: 65)\n- `org.mockito.internal.MockHandler:handle(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 97)\n- `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/Invocation;)Lorg/mockito/internal/stubbing/StubbedInvocationMatcher;` (method_id: 100)\n- `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:getDefaultAnswer()Lorg/mockito/stubbing/Answer;` (method_id: 99)\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the stubbing process and may be contributing to the failure of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [30, 65, 97, 100, 99]\n}\n```"
