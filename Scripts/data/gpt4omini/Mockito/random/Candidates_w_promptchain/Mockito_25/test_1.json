    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `will_return_default_value_on_non_mockable_nested_generic` is failing due to a `ClassCastException`. This indicates that there is an issue with type casting, likely related to the mocking framework being used (Mockito in this case).\n\n2. The stack trace points to a specific line in the test where the failure occurs, which is related to the method `returningNonMockableNestedGeneric()` of the `GenericsNest` class. This suggests that the method is expected to return a type that is not compatible with what is being cast.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the Mockito framework, particularly those related to mocking and handling invocations. The methods that are most relevant to the failure include those that deal with creating mocks, handling invocations, and managing the return types of mocked methods.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:getMock`** - This method is responsible for retrieving the mock object, which is crucial in the context of deep stubbing.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer`** - This method handles the answer returned by the mock, which could be related to the type mismatch.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:validatedSettings`** - This method validates the settings for creating mocks, which could affect the type being returned.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle`** - This method handles the invocation of the mock, which is directly related to the failure.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:getMethod`** - This method retrieves the method being invoked, which is essential for understanding the context of the failure.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods identified for further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 75, 72, 78, 36]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to understand how they interact with the mocked objects and to identify the root cause of the `ClassCastException`."
