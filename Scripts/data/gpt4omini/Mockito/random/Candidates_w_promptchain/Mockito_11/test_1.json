The stack trace indicates that an `AssertionFailedError` occurred, suggesting that the `equals` method is not functioning as expected.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mocking and injection, but the most relevant method to investigate is `org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:equals(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z`, which is directly related to the `equals` method being tested.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Method ID 38**: `org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:equals(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z`\n   - This method is directly involved in the equality check that is failing in the test.\n\n2. **Method ID 57**: `org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:<init>(Ljava/lang/reflect/Method;)V`\n   - This constructor initializes the `DelegatingMethod` object, which may affect how the `equals` method behaves.\n\n3. **Method ID 0**: `org.mockito.internal.util.collections.HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet:of(Ljava/lang/Iterable;)Lorg/mockito/internal/util/collections/HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet;`\n   - This method is responsible for creating a new instance of `HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet`, which may be related to how equality is handled in collections.\n\n4. **Method ID 12**: `org.mockito.internal.util.collections.HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet:of([Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/internal/util/collections/HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet;`\n   - Similar to method ID 0, this method also creates a new instance of `HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet` but takes an array of objects.\n\n5. **Method ID 31**: `org.mockito.internal.util.collections.HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet:addAll(Ljava/util/Collection;)Z`\n   - This method adds elements to the `HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet`, which could influence how equality is determined when collections are involved.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [38, 57, 0, 12, 31]\n}\n```"
