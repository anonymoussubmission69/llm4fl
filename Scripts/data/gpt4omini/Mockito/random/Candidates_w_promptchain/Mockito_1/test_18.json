    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** - This method is involved in capturing arguments from the invocation, which is critical in the context of mocking and stubbing. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` occurred here, suggesting that there might be an issue with how arguments are being captured or processed.\n\n2. **MockHandlerImpl.handle** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation and returning the appropriate response. Since the exception is thrown during the handling of the invocation, this method is crucial to investigate.\n\n3. **InvocationMatcher.getInvocation** - This method retrieves the invocation associated with the matcher. If the invocation is not set up correctly, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\n4. **MatchersBinder.bindMatchers** - This method binds matchers to the invocation. If there is a mismatch or an issue with the matchers, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\n5. **MockingProgressImpl.stubbingCompleted** - This method is called to indicate that stubbing has been completed. If there is an issue with the stubbing process, it could propagate and cause the test to fail.\n\n6. **ArgumentsProcessor.argumentsToMatchers** - This method converts arguments to matchers. If the arguments are not processed correctly, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\n7. **MockSettingsImpl.prepareExtraInterfaces** - This method prepares extra interfaces for the mock. If there is an issue with the interfaces being set up, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n8. **MockCreationValidator.validateType** - This method validates the type of the mock being created. If the type is not valid, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 6, 11, 12, 75, 96, 114]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
