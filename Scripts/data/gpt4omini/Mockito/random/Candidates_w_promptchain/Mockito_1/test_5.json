If there is an issue with how arguments are processed or matched, it could lead to the `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.checkers.NumberOfInvocationsChecker:check(Ljava/util/List;Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;I)V`** - This method checks the number of invocations against the expected count. If the invocation matcher is not set up correctly, it could lead to verification failures.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.Times:verify(Lorg/mockito/internal/verification/api/VerificationData;)V`** - This method is responsible for verifying the number of times a method was invoked. If the verification mode is not set correctly, it could lead to exceptions during verification.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Z`** - This method checks if a given invocation matches the expected invocation. If there is an issue with how the matchers are set up, it could lead to verification failures.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.ArgumentsProcessor:argumentsToMatchers([Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/util/List;`** - This method processes the arguments to matchers. If the arguments are not processed correctly, it could lead to mismatches during verification.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method handles the invocation and could throw exceptions if the invocation is not handled properly.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:verificationStarted(Lorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;)V`** - This method starts the verification process. If the mocking progress is not set up correctly, it could lead to exceptions during verification.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 151, 134, 212, 189, 175, 219]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the verification process and any issues within them could lead to the observed `UnsupportedOperationException`. Further investigation into these methods is warranted to identify the root cause of the failure."
