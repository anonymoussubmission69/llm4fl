    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `exception_message_when_constructor_not_found` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` which indicates that the expected behavior was not met. The test seems to be related to mocking a class with a constructor that cannot be found, which suggests that the mocking framework (Mockito) is involved in the failure.\n\nThe stack trace points to the `mock` method in the `MockitoCore` class, which is responsible for creating mocks. The failure could be related to how the mock is being created or how the settings for the mock are being validated.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mock creation, validation, and settings. Here are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`mock`** - This method is responsible for creating a mock object. If the constructor is not found, this method might be failing to handle that case properly.\n2. **`validatedSettings`** - This method validates the settings for the mock. If the settings are incorrect or if the constructor is not valid, this could lead to the failure.\n3. **`validateConstructorUse`** - This method checks if the constructor is being used correctly. If the constructor is not found, this method might be involved in the failure.\n4. **`isTypeMockable`** - This method checks if the type can be mocked. If the type is not mockable due to the constructor issue, this could also lead to the failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 4, 41, 82]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to understand why the test is failing and to identify the root cause of the issue."
