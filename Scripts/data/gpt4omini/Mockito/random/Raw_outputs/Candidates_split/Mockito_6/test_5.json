Since the test is failing when `null` is passed, this method might be involved in the logic that determines what value should be returned when `null` is provided.\n\n2. **Method ID 64**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.Returns:getReturnType()`\n   - This method retrieves the return type of the mocked method. If the return type is not handled correctly when `null` is passed, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [52, 64]\n}\n```"

If it does not handle `null` values properly, it could lead to unexpected behavior when `null` is passed as an argument.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle`** (Method ID: 127)\n   - This method handles the invocation and is crucial in determining what response is returned when a method is called on a mock.
