This indicates that there might be an issue with how the fields are being initialized or injected.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:process(Ljava/lang/Class;Ljava/lang/Object;)V` (method_id: 4)** - This method is responsible for processing annotations and could be involved in the injection of mocks. If it incorrectly processes the annotations, it could lead to the wrong field being initialized.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldSetter:set(Ljava/lang/Object;)V` (method_id: 18)** - This method sets the value of a field. If it is not setting the field correctly, it could lead to the observed behavior.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.ConstructorInjection:processInjection(Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/util/Set;)Z` (method_id: 23)** - This method processes the injection of mocks into fields. If it fails to inject the correct mock, it could result in the field being non-null when it should be null.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldInitializer:checkNotLocal(Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)V` (method_id: 0)** - This method checks if a field is a local class. If it incorrectly identifies a field, it could lead to improper initialization.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldInitializer:checkNotAbstract(Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)V` (method_id: 21)** - This method checks if a field is abstract. If it incorrectly processes an abstract field, it could lead to issues in field initialization.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 18, 23, 0, 21]\n}\n```"
