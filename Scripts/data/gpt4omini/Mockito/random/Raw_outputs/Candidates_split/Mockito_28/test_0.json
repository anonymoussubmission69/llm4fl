The stack trace points to a failure in the assertion that checks if two objects are the same.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods related to mocking and injection in the Mockito framework. The following methods are particularly suspicious as they are involved in the creation and injection of mocks, which is directly related to the failure observed in the test:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:createMockFor`** - This method is responsible for creating mocks based on annotations. If the mock is not created correctly, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:processInjectMocks`** - This method processes the injection of mocks into fields. If the injection logic is flawed, it could result in the wrong object being injected.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:process`** - This method processes the annotations on fields, which is crucial for setting up the mocks correctly.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:process`** - Similar to the previous method, this one is also involved in processing annotations and could affect the injection of mocks.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:createMockFor`** - This method is another point where mocks are created based on annotations, and any issues here could lead to the wrong object being used in the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 12, 3, 38, 37]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."

Given that the test is about mock injection, any issues in this method could directly affect the outcome of the test.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:initiateMockName`** (method_id: 51)\n   - This method initializes the name of the mock. If the mock is not being named or created correctly, it could lead to mismatches in the expected and actual objects during assertions.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [88, 51]\n}\n```"

If the property is not set correctly, it could lead to the assertion failure observed in the test.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:injectMocks(Ljava/lang/Object;)V` (Method ID: 147)**: This method is responsible for injecting mocks into the test class.

If there is a concurrency issue or improper state management in mocking, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the test.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:assertNoAnnotations(Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;[Ljava/lang/Class;)V`** (Method ID: 151)\n   - This method checks for annotations on fields.
