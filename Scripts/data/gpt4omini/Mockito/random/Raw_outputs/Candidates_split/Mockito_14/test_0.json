The stack trace indicates that the verification failed at line 29 of the test class.\n\nThe two most suspicious methods covered by the failed test that might be leading to the fault are:\n\n1. **Method ID 50**: `org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress:pullVerificationMode()`\n   - This method is responsible for pulling the verification mode, which is crucial for the verification process in Mockito. If this method does not function correctly, it could lead to issues in verifying whether the expected method was called.\n\n2. **Method ID 51**: `org.mockito.internal.verification.Times:verify(Lorg/mockito/internal/verification/api/VerificationData;)`\n   - This method handles the verification of invocations based on the expected count. If there is a problem with how the verification data is processed, it could result in the failure to recognize that `mock.otherMethod()` was not invoked.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [50, 51]\n}\n```"
