This indicates that the issue may stem from how type variables are being handled.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer`** (method_id: 21)\n   - This method is involved in providing deep stubs and is likely related to the failure since the test is trying to mock nested calls. If the return type is not mockable, it could lead to the exception seen.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:recordDeepStubAnswer`** (method_id: 9)\n   - This method is responsible for recording deep stub answers. If there is an issue with the type being mocked, it could lead to problems in this method as well.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.settings.CreationSettings:validatedSettings`** (method_id: 6)\n   - This method validates the settings for mock creation. If the settings are not valid due to type issues, it could lead to the failure observed.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:prepareExtraInterfaces`** (method_id: 3)\n   - This method prepares extra interfaces for the mock. If there are issues with the interfaces being used, it could contribute to the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [41, 21, 9, 6, 3]\n}\n```"

The test method `discoverDeepMockingOfGenerics` is attempting to create a mock of `MyClass1` with deep stubs enabled. The stack trace indicates that a `MockitoException` occurred due to \"Raw extraction not supported for: 'null'\". This suggests that there is an issue with handling generics or null values in the mocking process.\n\n2. The stack trace points to several methods involved in the mocking process, particularly in the `ReturnsDeepStubs` and `MockHandlerImpl` classes. The error seems to stem from the handling of generic types, which is a complex area in mocking frameworks.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the two most suspicious methods that need further analysis are:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:actualParameterizedType`** - This method is responsible for inferring the parameterized type of the mock, which is directly related to the issue of handling generics. If there is a problem in this method, it could lead to the exception observed.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle`** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation of mocked methods. Since the exception occurs during the invocation process, any issues in this method could also contribute to the failure.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [58, 91]\n}\n```"
