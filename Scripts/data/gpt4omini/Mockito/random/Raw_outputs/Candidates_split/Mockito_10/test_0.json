The failure indicates that the settings for serialization are not valid for the type being mocked, which is crucial in this context.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:validatedSettings`** - This method validates the settings for mock creation, including checking if the type to mock is serializable. Given the error message, this method is likely involved in the failure.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer`** - This method is responsible for handling the deep stubbing mechanism. The failure occurs when trying to access a deep stub, which suggests that this method may be involved in the serialization issue.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock`** - This method is responsible for creating a mock instance. The failure occurs during the mock creation process, making this method critical to investigate.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:serializable`** - This method sets the serializable mode for mock settings.
