"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'captureArgumentsFrom' in 'InvocationMatcher' throws an UnsupportedOperationException when handling varargs. This is directly related to the failure in the test where varargs are being used.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'stubVoid' in 'MockitoCore' is responsible for stubbing void methods. If there is an issue with how void methods are stubbed, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 149,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toThrow' in 'VoidMethodStubbableImpl' is used to specify that a void method should throw an exception. If this is not set up correctly, it could lead to the UnsupportedOperationException being thrown.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 193,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'when' in 'Mockito' is used to set up stubbing for method calls. If the setup is incorrect, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the failure of the test, particularly focusing on the handling of varargs and void method stubbing, which are critical in the context of the provided stack trace."
