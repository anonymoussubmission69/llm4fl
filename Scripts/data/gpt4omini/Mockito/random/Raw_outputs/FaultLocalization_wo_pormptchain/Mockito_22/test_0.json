"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'areEqual' method is directly involved in the equality checks performed in the test. The stack trace indicates that this method is called when the test fails, making it highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 27,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'areArrayElementsEqual' method is responsible for checking equality of array elements, which is relevant to the test case that involves arrays. If this method fails to correctly compare elements, it could lead to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'areArraysEqual' method is called to check if two arrays are equal. Since the test involves multiple array comparisons, any issue in this method could directly affect the test outcome.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'areArrayLengthsEqual' method checks if the lengths of two arrays are equal. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure, it is still relevant to the overall equality check of arrays.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
