"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious, ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 135,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'callRealMethod' is responsible for invoking the real method on a mock. The stack trace indicates that it attempts to call an abstract method, which is not allowed. This is the direct cause of the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 68,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'answer' in 'CallsRealMethods' is designed to return the result of calling a real method on a mock. If the method being called is abstract, it will lead to the same exception as seen in the stack trace.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 61,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'cannotCallAbstractRealMethod' throws an exception when there is an attempt to call an abstract method on a mock. This method is invoked when the failure occurs, indicating it is part of the fault chain.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 93,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'handle' in 'InvocationNotifierHandler' is responsible for handling method invocations on mocks. It may indirectly lead to the failure if it attempts to process an invocation that calls an abstract method.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the failure as indicated by the stack trace and their roles in the mocking framework."
