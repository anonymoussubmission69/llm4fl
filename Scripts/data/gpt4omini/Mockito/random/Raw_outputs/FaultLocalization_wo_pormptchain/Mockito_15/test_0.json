"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 97,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method injectMocks is responsible for injecting mocks into the fields of the test class. Since the test is failing due to an assertion related to property setter usage, this method is highly suspicious as it directly deals with the injection process.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The process method in InjectingAnnotationEngine is responsible for processing annotations like @InjectMocks.
