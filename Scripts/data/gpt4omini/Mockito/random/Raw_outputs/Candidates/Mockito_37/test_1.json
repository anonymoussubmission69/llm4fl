"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldFailWhenCallingRealMethodOnIterface` is designed to validate that calling a real method on an interface should fail. The failure occurs in the `validator.validate(new CallsRealMethods(), inovcationOnIterface);` line, which suggests that the `validate` method in the `AnswersValidator` class is a key area to investigate.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure is related to the `MockitoException`, which is likely thrown when the validation fails. The methods covered by the failed test include several that are involved in the mocking and validation process.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`validate`** (method_id: 0) - This is the method being called in the test, and it is crucial to understand its logic and how it handles the `CallsRealMethods` answer.\n2. **`mock`** (method_id: 1) - This method is responsible for creating mocks and may influence the behavior of the `validate` method.\n3. **`createMock`** (method_id: 2) - This method is involved in the creation of mocks and may have implications on how the `validate` method operates.\n4. **`validateMockedType`** (method_id: 3) - This method checks the type of the mocked object and could be relevant if the type is not handled correctly.\n5. **`validateState`** (method_id: 5) - This method checks the state of the mocking progress and could affect the validation process.\n6. **`resetOngoingStubbing`** (method_id: 4) - This method resets the ongoing stubbing, which might be relevant if there are issues with the stubbing state.\n7. **`validateExtraInterfaces`** (method_id: 11) - This method validates any extra interfaces that might be involved in the mocking process.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11]\n}\n```"
