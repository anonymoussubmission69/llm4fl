"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldFailFastWhenCallingRealMethodOnInterface` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` that occurs when trying to call a real method on a mocked interface. The stack trace indicates that the failure happens in the `shouldFailFastWhenCallingRealMethodOnInterface` method at line 28.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.ThreadSafeMockingProgress:getDebuggingInfo()`** - This method is involved in managing the mocking progress and could be related to the state of the mock.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.AnswersValidator:validate(...)`** - This method validates the answers provided to the mocks and could be responsible for ensuring that the correct behavior is set up for the mock.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock(...)`** - This method is responsible for creating the mock object and could be where the mock is incorrectly set up.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.BaseStubbing:thenCallRealMethod()`** - This method is directly related to the functionality being tested, as it attempts to call a real method on a mock, which is the source of the failure.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:isVoid()`** - This method checks if the invocation is void, which could be relevant in determining how the mock behaves when a real method is called.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they deal with the mocking framework's internal state and behavior when interacting with mocks. The failure in the test suggests that there may be an issue with how the mock is set up or how the real method invocation is being handled.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 36, 2]\n}\n```"
