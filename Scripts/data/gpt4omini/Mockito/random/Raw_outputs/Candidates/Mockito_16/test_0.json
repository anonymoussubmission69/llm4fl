"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is failing due to a `MissingMethodInvocationException`, which indicates that the `when()` method is being called without a valid method invocation on a mock object. This suggests that the issue lies in how the mock is being set up or used.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `when()` method in the `Mockito` framework, which is crucial for stubbing method calls on mocks. The error message suggests that the method being stubbed may not be a valid method call on a mock.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mocking and stubbing in the Mockito framework. The methods that are particularly relevant to the failure include:\n   - `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;` (method_id: 30)\n   - `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock(Ljava/lang/Class;Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 4)\n   - `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMocks:answer(Lorg/mockito/invocation/InvocationOnMock;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 33)\n   - `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:setInvocationForPotentialStubbing(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;)V` (method_id: 34)\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the mocking and stubbing process, and any issues in their implementation could lead to the observed exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods that need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [30, 4, 33, 34]\n}\n```"
