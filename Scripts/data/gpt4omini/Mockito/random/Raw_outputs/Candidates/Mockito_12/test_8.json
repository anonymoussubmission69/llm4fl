"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `shouldUseCaptorInOrdinaryWay` is attempting to use an `ArgumentCaptor` to capture a `Person` object. The test fails with a `ClassCastException` indicating that a `ParameterizedTypeImpl` cannot be cast to a `Class`. This suggests that there is an issue with how generics are being handled in the code.\n\n2. The stack trace points to several methods in the Mockito framework, particularly in the `GenericMaster` and `DefaultAnnotationEngine` classes, which are involved in processing annotations and creating mocks. The error seems to stem from the handling of generic types when creating mocks.\n\n3. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods related to mock creation and annotation processing, which are likely to be the source of the problem.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n- `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMaster:getGenericType(Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)Ljava/lang/Class;` (method_id: 17)\n- `org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:processAnnotationOn(Lorg/mockito/Captor;Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 7)\n- `org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:createMockFor(Ljava/lang/annotation/Annotation;Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 40)\n- `org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations:initMocks(Ljava/lang/Object;)V` (method_id: 6)\n- `org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:createMockFor(Ljava/lang/annotation/Annotation;Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 4)\n\nThese methods are involved in the creation and processing of mocks and annotations, which are directly related to the failure observed in the test.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [17, 7, 40, 6, 4]\n}\n```"
