"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`extractRawTypeOf`** (method_id: 41) - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace as throwing a `MockitoException` due to raw extraction not being supported for a null type. This indicates that it is likely involved in the failure.\n\n2. **`recordDeepStubAnswer`** (method_id: 9) - This method is responsible for recording deep stub answers, which is relevant to the deep mocking being tested. If there is an issue with how deep stubs are handled, this method could be implicated.\n\n3. **`answer`** (method_id: 21) - This method is part of the `ReturnsDeepStubs` class and is responsible for providing answers to invocations. It also interacts with the raw type extraction, making it a candidate for investigation.\n\n4. **`newDeepStubMock`** (method_id: 13) - This method creates new deep stub mocks and could be involved in the setup of the mocks that are failing in the test.\n\n5. **`mock`** (method_id: 52) - This is the main method for creating mocks in Mockito. If there is a fundamental issue with how mocks are created, it could lead to the problems observed in the test.\n\n6. **`mock`** (method_id: 2) - This is another overload of the mock method that takes `MockSettings`. It is also relevant as it deals with the configuration of mocks.\n\n7. **`mock`** (method_id: 63) - This method is another variant for mocking with a default answer, which could also be relevant to the failure.\n\n8. **`mock`** (method_id: 51) - This method checks for null values and could be involved in the failure if it is not handling nulls correctly.\n\n9. **`mockingStarted`** (method_id: 18) - This method is part of the mocking progress and could be involved in the state management of mocks.\n\n10. **`validateType`** (method_id: 30) - This method validates the type to be mocked and could be relevant if the type being mocked is not valid.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [41, 9, 21, 13, 52, 2, 63, 51, 18, 30]\n}\n```"
