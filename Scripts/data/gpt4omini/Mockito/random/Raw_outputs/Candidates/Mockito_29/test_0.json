"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldNotThrowNPEWhenNullPassedToSame` is designed to verify that passing `null` to the `objectArgMethod` does not throw a `NullPointerException` (NPE). However, the test fails because a `NullPointerException` is thrown instead of the expected `AssertionError`.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception originates from the `Same.describeTo` method, which is part of the Mockito framework. This suggests that the issue may be related to how the `same` matcher is handling `null` values.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the Mockito framework, particularly those related to argument matching and verification.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `org.mockito.internal.matchers.Same:describeTo` (method_id: 36)\n- `org.mockito.internal.verification.checkers.MissingInvocationChecker:check` (method_id: 77)\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches` (method_id: 73)\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:getArguments` (method_id: 74)\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:getMock` (method_id: 27)\n\nThese methods are involved in the argument matching and verification process, which is where the `NullPointerException` is being thrown. Analyzing these methods may help identify the root cause of the issue.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [36, 77, 73, 74, 27]\n}\n```"
