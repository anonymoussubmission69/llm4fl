"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldInjectUsingPropertySetterIfAvailable` failed due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected condition `awaitingInjection.propertySetterUsed` was not met. This suggests that there may be an issue with the injection process, particularly with how property setters are being utilized.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods related to mock injection and field initialization. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine:injectMocksOnFields`** (method_id: 19) - This method is responsible for injecting mocks into fields, which is directly related to the property setter usage.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:injectMocks`** (method_id: 97) - This method handles the overall injection process, including scanning for fields that require injection.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldSetter:set`** (method_id: 23) - This method sets the value of a field, which is crucial for property setter functionality.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldInitializer:initialize`** (method_id: 69) - This method initializes the field, which may affect whether the property setter is called correctly.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:process`** (method_id: 9) - This method processes annotations, which may include the `@InjectMocks` annotation that is relevant to the test.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, leading to the failure of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [19, 97, 23, 69, 9]\n}\n```"
