"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:serializable()`** - This method is related to the serialization settings of mocks. The error indicates that the type being mocked does not implement `Serializable`, which is crucial when using the `serializable()` setting.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:validatedSettings(Ljava/lang/Class;Lorg/mockito/internal/creation/settings/CreationSettings;)`** - This method validates the settings for creating mocks, including checking if the type to mock is serializable.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockCreationValidator:validateSerializable(Ljava/lang/Class;)`** - This method validates whether the class being mocked is serializable, which is directly related to the exception thrown.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer(Lorg/mockito/invocation/InvocationOnMock;)`** - This method is involved in handling deep stubs, which may be affected by the serialization issue.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:mock(Ljava/lang/Class;Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;)`** - This method is responsible for creating mocks and may propagate the serialization settings issue.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:serializableWontWorkForObjectsThatDontImplementSerializable(Ljava/lang/Class;)`** - This method is invoked when the mock creation fails due to the class not being serializable.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they all relate to the creation and validation of mocks, particularly in the context of serialization. The fault likely propagates through these methods, leading to the exception observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [83, 33, 53, 5, 4, 90]\n}\n```"
