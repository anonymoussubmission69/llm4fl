"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is designed to check that invoking `Mockito.after()` with a negative value throws a `FriendlyReminderException`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when the test attempts to invoke `Mockito.after(-1)`, which is expected to fail.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are relevant to the failure:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.Mockito:after(J)Lorg/mockito/verification/VerificationAfterDelay;`** - This method is directly invoked in the test and is responsible for handling the duration passed to it. If it does not handle negative values correctly, it could lead to the failure observed.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.Times:<init>(I)V`** - This constructor checks if the number of invocations is negative. If the `after` method does not validate the input properly, it could lead to this constructor being called with a negative value.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationOverTimeImpl:<init>(JJLorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;ZLorg/mockito/internal/util/Timer;)V`** - This method is part of the verification process and may be indirectly involved if the `after` method does not handle the negative duration correctly.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.util.Timer:<init>(J)V`** - This method initializes a timer with the duration. If the duration is negative, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.verification.After:<init>(JJLorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;)V`** - This constructor is also part of the verification process and may be involved if the `after` method does not validate the input properly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 4, 0, 1, 5]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement with the negative duration value and their potential to propagate the fault through the system."
