"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `should_throw_friendly_reminder_exception_when_duration_is_negative` is designed to check that a `Timer` cannot be created with a negative duration. The test fails when it attempts to create a `Timer` with a negative value, which should throw a `FriendlyReminderException`.\n\nFrom the stack trace, we can see that the failure occurs at the point where the `Timer` constructor is called. This indicates that the constructor of the `Timer` class is likely the source of the issue.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the Mockito framework, but the most relevant method to investigate is the `Timer` constructor, which is identified by the method signature `org.mockito.internal.util.Timer:<init>(J)V` and has a method ID of 13.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed:\n\n1. **Timer Constructor**: `org.mockito.internal.util.Timer:<init>(J)V` - This is the method that is directly involved in the test failure. We need to check how it handles negative values for `durationMillis`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object summarizing the findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [13]\n}\n```"
