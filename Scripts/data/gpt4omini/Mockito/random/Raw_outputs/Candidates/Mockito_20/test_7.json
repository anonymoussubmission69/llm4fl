"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `exception_message_when_constructor_not_found` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` which indicates that the expected behavior was not met. The test seems to be related to mocking a class with a constructor that could not be found, which suggests that the mocking framework (Mockito) is involved in the failure.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the Mockito framework, particularly those related to mock creation and validation. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`mock`** - This method is responsible for creating a mock object. If there is an issue with the constructor or the class being mocked, this could lead to the failure.\n2. **`validatedSettings`** - This method validates the settings for creating mocks, including checking if the constructor can be used. If the settings are incorrect, it could lead to the failure.\n3. **`validateConstructorUse`** - This method specifically checks if the constructor is being used correctly. If there is a problem with how the constructor is being utilized, this could directly cause the test to fail.\n4. **`createMock`** - This method is responsible for creating the actual mock instance. If there is an issue during this process, it could lead to the failure.\n5. **`isUsingConstructor`** - This method checks if the constructor is being used for the mock. If it returns an incorrect value, it could lead to the failure.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the observed test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 4, 82, 20, 41]\n}\n```"
