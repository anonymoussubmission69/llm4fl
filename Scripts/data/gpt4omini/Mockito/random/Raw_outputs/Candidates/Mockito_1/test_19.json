"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `shouldStubBooleanVarargs` is attempting to stub a method `withBooleanVarargs` on a mock object. The test fails with an `UnsupportedOperationException`, which indicates that the method being called is not supported in the current context.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the exception originates from the `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom` method, which suggests that there may be an issue with how arguments are being captured or processed for the mocked method.\n\n3. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various internal methods of the Mockito framework, particularly those related to invocation matching, mocking progress, and argument handling.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are identified as suspicious and warrant further analysis:\n\n- **InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom** (method_id: 0): This method is directly involved in capturing arguments for the invocation and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **MockHandlerImpl.handle** (method_id: 1): This method is responsible for handling the invocation and may be related to the unsupported operation.\n- **MockMethodInterceptor.doIntercept** (method_id: 2): This method is part of the interception process for mocked methods and could be relevant to the failure.\n- **InvocationMatcher.getInvocation** (method_id: 6): This method retrieves the invocation associated with the matcher and may be involved in the argument capturing process.\n- **MockingProgressImpl.stubbingCompleted** (method_id: 2): This method indicates the completion of stubbing and may be relevant to the state of the mocking framework at the time of the failure.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 6, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes methods that are directly involved in the invocation handling and argument capturing process, which are critical to understanding the cause of the failure in the test."
