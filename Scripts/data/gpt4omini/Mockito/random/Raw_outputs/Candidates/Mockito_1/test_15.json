"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/util/List;)V`** - This method is involved in creating an `InvocationMatcher`, which is crucial for matching method calls in Mockito. If there is an issue with how arguments are captured or matched, it could lead to the `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldInitializer$ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator:instantiate`** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is responsible for instantiating objects using parameterized constructors. If it fails to handle the provided arguments correctly, it could lead to the exception observed.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldInitializer$ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator$1:compare`** - This method is involved in comparing constructors, which is part of the instantiation process. If there is an issue with how constructors are compared or selected, it could lead to instantiation failures.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl.handle`** - This method is part of the mock handling process. If the mock is not set up correctly, it could lead to exceptions when the mock is invoked.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:stubbingCompleted`** - This method is involved in completing the stubbing process. If there are issues with the stubbing state, it could lead to unexpected behavior during test execution.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:process`** - This method processes annotations for mocks. If there are issues with how mocks are initialized or configured, it could lead to runtime exceptions.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection:tryConstructorInjection`** - This method attempts to inject mocks into constructors. If the injection fails, it could lead to the observed exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 81, 53, 96, 2, 3, 83]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
