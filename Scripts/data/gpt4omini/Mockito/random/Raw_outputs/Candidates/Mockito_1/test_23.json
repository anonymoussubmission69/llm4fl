"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/util/List;)V`** - This method is involved in creating an `InvocationMatcher`, which is crucial for matching method calls in Mockito. The stack trace indicates that an exception occurred during the invocation matching process.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldInitializer$ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator:instantiate()`** - This method is responsible for instantiating objects using parameterized constructors. The test indicates that it is trying to instantiate a class that throws an exception, which is directly related to the failure.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultAnnotationEngine:process(Ljava/lang/Class;Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This method processes annotations and may be involved in setting up mocks or spies, which could lead to issues if not handled correctly.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:stubbingCompleted(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)V`** - This method is part of the mocking progress management and could be related to the state of the mocks when the exception occurs.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection:tryConstructorInjection()`** - This method attempts to inject mocks into constructors, which is relevant given that the test is about constructor behavior.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:notifyMethodCallException(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/lang/Throwable;)V`** - This method handles exceptions during method calls, which is directly related to the exception thrown in the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 94, 3, 2, 82, 53]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
