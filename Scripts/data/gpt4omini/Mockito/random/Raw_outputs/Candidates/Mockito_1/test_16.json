"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/util/List;)V`** - This method is involved in creating an `InvocationMatcher`, which is crucial for matching method invocations. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurred while capturing arguments from this invocation matcher.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.checkers.NumberOfInvocationsChecker.check(NumberOfInvocationsChecker.java:48)`** - This method is responsible for checking the number of invocations. The failure in the test suggests that the verification of the number of invocations might not be functioning correctly.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl.handle(MockHandlerImpl.java:76)`** - This method handles the invocation of mocks. If there is an issue with how mocks are being handled, it could lead to the `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getInvocation()Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;`** - This method retrieves the invocation associated with the matcher. If the invocation is not set correctly, it could lead to issues during verification.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.Mockito:times(I)Lorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;`** - This method is used to specify the number of times a method should be invoked. If there is a problem with how this is set up, it could lead to verification failures.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl:pullVerificationMode()Lorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;`** - This method retrieves the current verification mode. If the verification mode is not set correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior during verification.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.util.ObjectMethodsGuru:isToString(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/MockitoMethod;)Z`** - This method checks if a method is a `toString` method. If the method is incorrectly identified, it could lead to issues in how invocations are matched.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 40, 41, 11, 6, 29, 61]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the failure as indicated by the stack trace and their role in the verification process."
