"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `equals_should_return_true_when_equal` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` when asserting that two `DelegatingMethod` instances are equal. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `equals` method of the `DelegatingMethod` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mocking and injection strategies, but the most relevant ones to investigate are those that directly relate to the `equals` method and the `DelegatingMethod` class.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:equals(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z` (method_id: 38)** - This is the method that is directly involved in the failure. It is responsible for determining equality between `DelegatingMethod` instances.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:<init>(Ljava/lang/reflect/Method;)V` (method_id: 57)** - The constructor for `DelegatingMethod`, which initializes the method instance. If the method is not initialized correctly, it could lead to issues in the `equals` method.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.util.collections.HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet:of(Ljava/lang/Iterable;)Lorg/mockito/internal/util/collections/HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet;` (method_id: 0)** - This method is involved in creating a set that may be used in the context of equality checks.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.util.collections.HashCodeAndEqualsSafeSet:addAll(Ljava/util/Collection;)Z` (method_id: 31)** - This method adds elements to a collection and may be relevant if the `equals` method relies on collections for comparison.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil:isSpy(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z` (method_id: 13)** - While not directly related, if the `DelegatingMethod` is being used in a context where it is expected to behave like a spy, it could affect equality checks.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe methods listed above are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test. The primary focus should be on the `equals` method and its constructor, as they are directly related to the assertion that is failing.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [38, 57, 0, 31, 13]\n}\n```"
