"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldNotThrowNPEWhenIntegerPassedToEq` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` at line 45, which indicates that there is an issue with the method `intArgumentMethod` being called on a mock object. The test is verifying that the method `intArgumentMethod` is called with an `Integer` argument.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **CGLIBProxyRealMethod**: This method is involved in creating proxy methods for mocks. If there is an issue with how the proxy is set up, it could lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n2. **Invocation**: This class handles the invocation of methods on mocks. If the invocation is not set up correctly, it could lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n3. **MockUtil**: This utility class is responsible for creating mocks. If the mock is not created properly, it could lead to issues when invoking methods on it.\n4. **MatchersBinder**: This class binds matchers to invocations. If the matchers are not set up correctly, it could lead to a failure in the verification step.\n5. **MockHandler**: This class handles the invocation of methods on mocks. If there is an issue in how the method is handled, it could lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 66, 92]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the `NullPointerException` in the test."
