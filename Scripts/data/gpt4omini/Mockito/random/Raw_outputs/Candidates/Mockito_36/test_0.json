"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldFailInRuntimeWhenCallingRealMethodOnInterface` is attempting to call a real method on a mocked interface (`List`), which is expected to fail. The stack trace indicates a `NoSuchMethodError`, suggesting that the method being called does not exist in the context of the mock.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the error occurs when invoking the `get` method on the mocked `List`, which is likely due to the way the mock is set up to call real methods.\n\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace and the covered methods by the failed test include several that deal with invocation, mocking, and method proxying, particularly those related to calling real methods on mocks.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:callRealMethod()`\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke()`\n- `org.mockito.internal.creation.AbstractMockitoMethodProxy:invokeSuper()`\n- `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.AnswersValidator:validate()`\n- `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:isVoid()`\n\nThese methods are directly related to the invocation of real methods on mocks and the validation of answers, which are critical in understanding why the `NoSuchMethodError` occurred.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 4, 10, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
