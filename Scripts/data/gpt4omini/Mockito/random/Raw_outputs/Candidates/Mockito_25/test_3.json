"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `can_create_mock_from_return_types_declared_with_a_bounded_wildcard` is attempting to create a mock object and call a method that returns a wildcard type. The failure occurs when trying to cast the result of `mock.returningWildcard().get(45)` to `Number`, leading to a `ClassCastException`.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception is thrown at line 80 of the test method, which suggests that the issue is related to the return type of the method being mocked.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to mocking and handling invocations, particularly in the `ReturnsDeepStubs` class, which is responsible for returning deep stubs for mocked objects.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 0**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:getMock(...)` - This method is responsible for retrieving the mock object, which is central to the test.\n- **Method ID 2**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs$1:recordDeepStubMock(...)` - This method records the deep stub mock, which is likely involved in the return type handling.\n- **Method ID 56**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:actualParameterizedType(...)` - This method infers the parameterized type of the mock, which could be related to the wildcard return type.\n- **Method ID 83**: `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs:answer(...)` - This method handles the answer for the invocation, which is crucial for determining what the mock should return.\n\nThese methods are likely involved in the process that leads to the `ClassCastException` when the test attempts to cast the return value to `Number`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 56, 83]\n}\n```"
