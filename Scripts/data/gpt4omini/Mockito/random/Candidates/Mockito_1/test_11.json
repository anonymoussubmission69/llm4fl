    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:<init>(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;Ljava/util/List;)V`** - This method is involved in creating an `InvocationMatcher`, which is crucial for matching method invocations. The stack trace indicates that the fault occurred during the argument capturing process, which is directly related to this method.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.checkers.NumberOfInvocationsChecker.check`** - This method is responsible for checking the number of invocations. The exception thrown suggests that there might be an issue with how the verification of invocations is being handled.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl.handle`** - This method is part of the mock handling process. Since the error is related to invocation handling, this method could be a point of failure.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getInvocation`** - This method retrieves the invocation associated with the matcher. If there is an issue with the invocation being captured or matched, this method could be implicated.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.progress.MockingProgressImpl.pullVerificationMode`** - This method is involved in managing the verification mode during mocking. If the verification mode is not set correctly, it could lead to the observed exception.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl.getInvocations`** - This method retrieves the list of invocations. If there is an issue with how invocations are stored or retrieved, it could contribute to the failure.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.ArgumentsProcessor.expandVarArgs`** - This method processes variable arguments. Given that the test involves varargs, any issues in this method could directly affect the test outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 36, 37, 5, 26, 99, 96]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the failure as indicated by the stack trace and their relevance to the test case being executed."
