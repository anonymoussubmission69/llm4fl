"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `can_create_mock_with_constructor` is failing because the expected message \"hey!\" is not being returned, and instead, `null` is being returned. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the mock's constructor or the way the mock is being set up.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'answer' method in 'CallsRealMethods' is responsible for invoking the real method on the mock. If the real method is not set up correctly or if the invocation fails, it could lead to a null return value. This method is crucial in determining how the mock behaves when a real method is called.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'callRealMethod' method in 'InterceptedInvocation' checks if the super method is invokable and then calls it. If the super method is not set up correctly or if it cannot be invoked, it could also lead to a null return value. This method is directly involved in the invocation process.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'isInvokable' method in 'SuperMethod' determines if the method can be invoked. If this method returns false, it would prevent the real method from being called, leading to a null return value. This method is critical in the invocation chain.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'useConstructor' method in 'MockSettingsImpl' sets the flag for using the constructor. If this flag is not set correctly, it could lead to the mock not being initialized properly, resulting in a null return value. This method is important for the initial setup of the mock.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the mock creation and invocation process, which are critical to the test's success."
