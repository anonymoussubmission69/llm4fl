"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'callRealMethod' is directly involved in invoking the real method on a mock object. The stack trace indicates that this method is part of the call chain leading to the NoSuchMethodError, suggesting that it may be trying to call a method that does not exist.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'invokeSuper' is responsible for invoking the superclass method. If the superclass method does not exist or is not accessible, it could lead to the NoSuchMethodError observed in the stack trace.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'invoke' in 'CGLIBProxyRealMethod' is responsible for invoking the method on the target object. If the method being invoked does not exist, it could also lead to the NoSuchMethodError.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod' invoke method is part of the proxy mechanism and could be involved in the method resolution process that leads to the NoSuchMethodError.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'mock' method is responsible for creating mock instances. If the mock is not set up correctly, it could lead to issues when trying to call methods on it, potentially causing the NoSuchMethodError.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the direct involvement of the methods in the call stack leading to the error and their roles in method invocation and mocking."
