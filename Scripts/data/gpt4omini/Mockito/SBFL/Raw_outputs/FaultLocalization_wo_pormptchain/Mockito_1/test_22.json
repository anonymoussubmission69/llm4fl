"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 196,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toThrow' in 'VoidMethodStubbableImpl' is responsible for stubbing a void method to throw an exception. The test is expecting a RuntimeException to be thrown, and if this method is not correctly implemented, it could lead to the test failing.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 204,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'stubVoid' in 'MockitoCore' is used to create a stubbable void method. If this method does not properly handle the stubbing of void methods, it could lead to the test not behaving as expected.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 201,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'addAnswerForVoidMethod' in 'InvocationContainerImpl' adds an answer for a void method. If this method does not correctly register the answer, it could cause the expected exception not to be thrown.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 61,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'handle' in 'InvocationNotifierHandler' is responsible for handling method invocations. If this method does not correctly notify the invocation or handle exceptions, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their relevance to the failure observed in the test, particularly focusing on the handling of exceptions and stubbing behavior."
