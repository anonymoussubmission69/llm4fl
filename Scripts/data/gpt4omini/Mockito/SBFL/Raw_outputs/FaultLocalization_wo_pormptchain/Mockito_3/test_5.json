"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'captureArgumentsFrom' in 'InvocationMatcher' is responsible for capturing arguments from an invocation.

This suggests that there may be an issue with how arguments are being captured, making this method highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getAllValues' in 'CapturingMatcher' retrieves all captured values.
