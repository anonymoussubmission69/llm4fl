"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getSuspiciouslyNotMatchingArgsIndexes' is directly involved in the test case and is responsible for processing the input arguments. The NullPointerException suggests that it may not be handling null values correctly, which is critical given the test case is designed to check behavior when a null argument is provided.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toStringEquals' is called within the 'getSuspiciouslyNotMatchingArgsIndexes' method.

This makes it suspicious as it could be a contributing factor to the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'safelyMatches' is also called within the context of argument matching.
