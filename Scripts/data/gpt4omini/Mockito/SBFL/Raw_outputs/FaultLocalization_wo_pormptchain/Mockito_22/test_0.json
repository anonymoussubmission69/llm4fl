"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'areEqual' method is the main entry point for equality checks in the test.
