"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `can_create_mock_with_constructor` is failing because the expected message \"hey!\" is not being returned, and instead, `null` is being returned. This indicates that there is an issue with the mock object being created, specifically with the constructor or the method that retrieves the message.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:useConstructor()`** - This method is responsible for setting up the mock to use a constructor. If this is not set up correctly, it could lead to the mock not being initialized properly.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.bytebuddy.InterceptedInvocation:callRealMethod()`** - This method is responsible for calling the real method on the mock. If the real method is not being called correctly, it could lead to the mock returning `null`.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods:answer(InvocationOnMock)`** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation on the mock and returning the appropriate response. If this method is not functioning correctly, it could lead to the mock returning `null`.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.bytebuddy.MockMethodInterceptor:interceptSuperCallable()`** - This method intercepts calls to the super class methods. If there is an issue with this interception, it could prevent the correct method from being called.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockUtil:createMock()`** - This method is responsible for creating the mock object. If there is an issue in the creation process, it could lead to the mock not being initialized properly.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.bytebuddy.ByteBuddyMockMaker:createMock()`** - This method is responsible for creating the mock using ByteBuddy. Any issues here could lead to the mock not being set up correctly.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.settings.CreationSettings:getSpiedInstance()`** - This method retrieves the spied instance, which could be relevant if the mock is supposed to wrap an existing instance.\n\n8. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.settings.CreationSettings:isUsingConstructor()`** - This method checks if the constructor is being used for the mock. If this is returning false when it should be true, it could lead to the issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 19, 38]\n}\n```"
