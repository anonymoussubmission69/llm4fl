"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `exception_message_when_constructor_not_found` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` which indicates that the expected behavior of the test is not being met. The test is trying to verify the behavior of the `spy` method from Mockito when a constructor is not found.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.Mockito:spy(Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method is directly invoked in the test and is likely where the failure originates.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:useConstructor()Lorg/mockito/MockSettings;`** - This method is related to the settings used for creating mocks and could be involved in the constructor resolution.\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.util.MockCreationValidator:validateConstructorUse(ZLorg/mockito/mock/SerializableMode;)V`** - This method validates the use of constructors and could be responsible for the failure if the constructor is not found.\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:isUsingConstructor()Z`** - This method checks if the constructor is being used, which is relevant to the test's context.\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl:getSpiedInstance()Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method retrieves the instance being spied on, which could also be relevant to the failure.\n\nThese methods are critical to understanding why the test is failing, as they are directly related to the mocking and spying behavior that the test is trying to validate.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 34, 33, 41]\n}\n```"
