"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:cannotCallAbstractRealMethod()`** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace as the source of the exception. It indicates that an attempt was made to call a real method on an abstract class, which is not allowed.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationImpl:callRealMethod()`** - This method is responsible for invoking the real method on the mock. The stack trace indicates that it checks if the method is abstract and calls the reporter if it is.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods:answer(...)`** - This method is involved in handling the invocation of real methods on mocks. It is crucial to analyze how it interacts with the invocation and whether it correctly handles abstract methods.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:isAbstract()`** - This method checks if a method is abstract. It is important to verify if it is being used correctly in the context of the test.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(...)`** - This method handles the invocation of methods on mocks. It is essential to check how it processes the invocation and whether it leads to the reported issue.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 78]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the exception thrown during the test execution, indicating they are likely candidates for further analysis to identify the root cause of the failure."
