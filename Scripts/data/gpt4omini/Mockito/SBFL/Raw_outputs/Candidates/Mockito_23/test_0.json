"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is failing due to a `NotSerializableException` related to the `ReturnsDeepStubs` class from Mockito. The test attempts to serialize a mock object created with deep stubs, but it seems that the mock object is not serializable, leading to the exception.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **ReturnsDeepStubs$2:answer** - This method is part of the deep stubbing mechanism and is likely involved in the serialization process.\n2. **ReturnsDeepStubs:getMock** - This method retrieves the mock object and may be involved in the serialization process.\n3. **ReturnsDeepStubs:createNewDeepStubMock** - This method creates a new deep stub mock and could be related to the serialization issue.\n4. **ReturnsDeepStubs:recordDeepStubMock** - This method records the deep stub mock and may be involved in the serialization process.\n5. **MockSettingsImpl:serializable** - This method sets the mock settings to be serializable, which is directly related to the issue at hand.\n6. **MockHandlerImpl:getInvocationContainer** - This method retrieves the invocation container, which may be relevant to the serialization process.\n\nThese methods are directly related to the creation, management, and serialization of mocks, which are critical to understanding the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3, 6, 26, 74]\n}\n```"
