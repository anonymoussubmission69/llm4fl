"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is designed to check that invoking `Mockito.after()` with a negative value throws a `FriendlyReminderException`. The stack trace indicates that the test fails when it attempts to invoke `Mockito.after(-1)`, which suggests that the method responsible for handling the duration is not correctly validating the input.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several constructors and methods related to the `Timer`, `After`, and `VerificationModeFactory` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.Mockito:after(J)Lorg/mockito/verification/VerificationAfterDelay;`** - This method is directly invoked in the test and is responsible for creating a new `After` instance with the provided duration. If it does not handle negative values correctly, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.util.Timer:<init>(J)V`** - This constructor initializes a `Timer` with the duration in milliseconds. If the duration is negative, it may not throw an exception, leading to unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.verification.After:<init>(JLorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;)V`** - This constructor is called when creating an `After` instance. If it does not validate the duration passed to it, it could also contribute to the failure.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationOverTimeImpl:<init>(JJLorg/mockito/verification/VerificationMode;Z)V`** - This constructor is part of the verification process and may also be involved in handling the duration.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationModeFactory:times(I)Lorg/mockito/internal/verification/Times;`** - Although not directly related to the duration, if the verification mode is not set up correctly, it could lead to issues in the verification process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 2, 5, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to determine if they correctly handle negative duration values and throw the appropriate exceptions as expected by the test."
