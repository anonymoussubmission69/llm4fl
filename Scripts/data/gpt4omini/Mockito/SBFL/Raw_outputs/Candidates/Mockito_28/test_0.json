"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `mock_should_be_injected_once_and_in_the_best_matching_type` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected object is not the same as the actual object. The test is asserting that two references are the same, which suggests that there may be an issue with how mocks are being injected or created.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in mock injection and comparison:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:injectMocks(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This method is responsible for injecting mocks into the test class. If there is an issue with how mocks are being injected, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine:injectMocksOnFields(Ljava/util/Set;Ljava/util/Set;Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This method handles the actual injection of mocks into fields. Any issues here could directly affect the outcome of the test.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:scanMocks(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/util/Set;`** - This method scans for mocks in the test class. If it fails to find the correct mocks or misidentifies them, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine:scanForInjection(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/util/Set;`** - This method scans for fields that require mock injection. If it does not correctly identify the fields, it could lead to incorrect behavior in the test.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine:injectMockCandidate(Ljava/lang/Class;Ljava/util/Set;Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This method is responsible for injecting a specific mock candidate into a field. If the wrong candidate is injected, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine:orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(Ljava/lang/Class;)[Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;`** - This method orders fields for injection. If the ordering is incorrect, it could affect which mocks are injected into which fields.\n\nGiven the context of the test failure, these methods are critical to investigate further to identify the root cause of the issue.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 8, 4, 3, 9, 10]\n}\n```"
