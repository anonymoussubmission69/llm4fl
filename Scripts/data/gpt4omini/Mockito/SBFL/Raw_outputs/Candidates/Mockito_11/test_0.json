"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `equals_should_return_true_when_equal` is failing due to an assertion error when checking if two `DelegatingMethod` instances are equal. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `assertTrue` method, which suggests that the `equals` method of the `DelegatingMethod` class is likely not functioning as expected.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include the `equals` method of the `DelegatingMethod` class, which directly relates to the failure. Additionally, the constructor of `DelegatingMethod` is also relevant since it initializes the object being tested.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:equals(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z`** - This method is directly involved in the failure as it is being called during the assertion.\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod:<init>(Ljava/lang/reflect/Method;)V`** - This constructor initializes the `DelegatingMethod` instance and could affect the state of the object being tested.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 4]\n}\n```"
