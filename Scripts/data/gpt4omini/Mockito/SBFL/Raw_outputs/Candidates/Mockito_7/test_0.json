"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`extractRawTypeOf`** (method_id: 9): This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace as throwing a `MockitoException` when it encounters a type that it cannot handle. The error message indicates that raw extraction is not supported for a certain type, which is likely the root cause of the failure.\n\n2. **`rawType`** (method_id: 8): This method calls `extractRawTypeOf`, and if it fails, it could lead to the same exception being thrown. It is crucial to analyze how this method interacts with the type variable.\n\n3. **`returnsDeepStubsAnswerUsing`** (method_id: 17): This method is involved in the process of returning deep stubs, which is related to the mocking behavior that is being tested. If there is an issue with how deep stubs are being handled, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n4. **`deepStub`** (method_id: 13): This method is responsible for creating deep stubs and could be implicated in the failure if it does not handle certain types correctly.\n\n5. **`answer`** (method_id: 25): This method is part of the mocking framework and is responsible for providing answers to method calls on mocks. If it encounters an unsupported type, it could lead to the same exception.\n\n6. **`mock`** (method_id: 37): This method is responsible for creating mocks and could be involved in the setup of the test that leads to the failure.\n\n7. **`getActualTypeArgumentFor`** (method_id: 10): This method retrieves the actual type argument for a type variable and could be involved in the type resolution that leads to the exception.\n\n8. **`extraInterfaces`** (method_id: 2): This method retrieves extra interfaces for a type variable and could be relevant if the type variable is not handled correctly.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [9, 8, 17, 13, 25, 37, 10, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the exact cause of the failure in the test."
