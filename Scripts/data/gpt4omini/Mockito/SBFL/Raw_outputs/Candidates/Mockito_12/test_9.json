"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldDealWithNestedGenerics` is failing due to a `ClassCastException` when trying to cast a `ParameterizedType` to a `Class`. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs in the `getGenericType` method of the `GenericMaster` class.\n\nThe covered method identified is:\n- `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMaster:getGenericType(Field field)`\n\nThis method is suspicious because it is directly involved in the operation that led to the exception. The method attempts to cast the result of `getActualTypeArguments()[0]` to a `Class`, which is likely the source of the `ClassCastException`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
