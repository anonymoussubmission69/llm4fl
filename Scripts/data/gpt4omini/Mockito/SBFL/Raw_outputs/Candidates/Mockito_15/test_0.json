"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldInjectUsingPropertySetterIfAvailable` failed due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected condition `awaitingInjection.propertySetterUsed` was not met. This suggests that the property setter injection mechanism did not work as intended.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods related to mock injection and field setting. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`filterCandidate`** (method_id: 0, 10, 11, 7) - This method is responsible for filtering candidates for injection based on certain criteria. If it fails to identify the correct candidate, the property setter may not be used.\n2. **`injectMocks`** (method_id: 1) - This method orchestrates the injection of mocks into the test class. If there is an issue here, it could prevent the property setter from being utilized.\n3. **`scanForInjection`** (method_id: 2) - This method scans for fields that require injection. If it fails to identify the field correctly, the property setter won't be invoked.\n4. **`scanMocks`** (method_id: 3) - This method scans for mock fields. If it does not find the correct mock, the injection will not occur as expected.\n5. **`injectMocksOnFields`** (method_id: 4) - This method is responsible for injecting mocks into the identified fields. If it does not execute correctly, the property setter will not be used.\n6. **`FieldSetter.set`** (method_id: 51) - This method sets the value of a field. If it fails to set the value correctly, the property setter will not be marked as used.\n\nThese methods are critical to the injection process and any issues within them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 51]\n}\n```"
