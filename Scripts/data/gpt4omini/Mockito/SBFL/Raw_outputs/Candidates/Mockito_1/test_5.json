"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Z` (Method ID: 18)** - This method is responsible for matching invocations, and since the test is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException`, it is crucial to check if the matching logic is correctly implemented.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom(InvocationMatcher.java:123)` (Method ID: 123)** - This method is part of the stack trace and is directly related to capturing arguments from invocations. Any issues here could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.verification.checkers.NumberOfInvocationsChecker:check(NumberOfInvocationsChecker.java:48)` (Method ID: 48)** - This method checks the number of invocations, which is central to the verification process in the test. If the invocation count is not being tracked correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (Method ID: 41)** - This method handles the invocation and notifies listeners. If there is an issue in handling the invocation, it could lead to exceptions being thrown.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle(Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (Method ID: 43)** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation and could be a source of the problem if it does not manage the invocation correctly.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.ArgumentsComparator:argumentsMatch(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Z` (Method ID: 17)** - This method compares arguments for matching. If the arguments are not being compared correctly, it could lead to verification failures.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.ArgumentsComparator:varArgsMatch(Lorg/mockito/internal/invocation/InvocationMatcher;Lorg/mockito/invocation/Invocation;)Z` (Method ID: 16)** - This method specifically deals with variable arguments matching, which is relevant given the use of varargs in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [18, 123, 48, 41, 43, 17, 16]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical to the functionality being tested and should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure."
