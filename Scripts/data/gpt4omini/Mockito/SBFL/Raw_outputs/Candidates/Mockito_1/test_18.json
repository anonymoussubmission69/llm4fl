"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom`** - This method is involved in capturing arguments from the invocation, and the stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` occurred here. This suggests that there might be an issue with how arguments are being handled.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle`** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation. Since the exception is thrown during the handling of the invocation, it is crucial to analyze this method to understand how it processes the invocation and why it might fail.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer`** - This method adds an answer to the invocation container. If there is an issue with how answers are being added or managed, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:hasInvocationForPotentialStubbing`** - This method checks if there are any invocations for potential stubbing. If this check fails or behaves unexpectedly, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor`** - This method finds the answer for a given invocation. If it fails to find a valid answer, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.ArgumentsComparator:varArgsMatch`** - This method is responsible for matching variable arguments. Given that the test involves varargs, any issues in this method could directly affect the test outcome.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.ArgumentsComparator:argumentsMatch`** - Similar to the previous method, this one checks if the arguments match. Any discrepancies here could lead to the failure of the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [23, 71, 64, 27, 56, 24, 22]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further investigated to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
