"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:notifyMethodCallException`** - This method is involved in handling exceptions during method calls, which is directly related to the `UnsupportedOperationException` that was thrown.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom`** - This method is part of the invocation matching process and is likely involved in capturing arguments for the invocation that failed.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle`** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation and could be where the exception is propagated from.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldInitializer$ParameterizedConstructorInstantiator:instantiate`** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is responsible for instantiating the object that is expected to throw an exception.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.FieldInitializer$ConstructorArgumentResolver:resolveTypeInstances`** - This method is involved in resolving the constructor arguments and could be related to the failure if it does not handle certain cases correctly.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.matchers.AnyVararg:matches`** - This method is part of the matching process and could be involved in the failure if it does not correctly match the expected arguments.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.matchers.ArrayEquals:createObjectArray`** - This method is responsible for creating an object array and could be involved if the array creation does not handle certain types correctly.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 24, 72, 57, 2, 3, 1]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
