    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `shouldRemoveAllStubbing` is attempting to reset a mock object after setting up some stubbing with `when(...)`. The failure occurs due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` thrown from `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom`.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception is thrown from the `InvocationMatcher` class, specifically in the `captureArgumentsFrom` method. This suggests that there may be an issue with how arguments are being captured or processed during the invocation of the mocked method.\n\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include various methods related to argument matching, stubbing, and invocation handling. The methods that are particularly relevant to the failure include those that deal with argument capturing, invocation matching, and stubbing.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n- **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:captureArgumentsFrom`** (method_id: 123) - This is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches`** (method_id: 22) - This method is involved in matching invocations, which may relate to the failure.\n- **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer`** (method_id: 60) - This method is responsible for adding answers to invocations, which could be related to the stubbing process.\n- **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:resetInvocationForPotentialStubbing`** (method_id: 37) - This method is involved in resetting the invocation state, which is relevant to the test's purpose.\n- **`org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:handle`** (method_id: 65) - This method handles the invocation and may be involved in the error propagation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further to find the fault:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [22, 60, 37, 65]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the context of the failure and should be examined to understand the root cause of the `UnsupportedOperationException`."
