    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.InvocationNotifierHandler:notifyMethodCallException`** - This method is involved in handling exceptions during method calls, which is relevant since the stack trace indicates a `RuntimeException` was expected but not handled properly.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.handler.MockHandlerImpl:handle`** - This method is responsible for handling the invocation of mocked methods. The stack trace indicates that the invocation handling might not be functioning as expected.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher:matches`** - This method checks if the invocation matches the expected invocation. If there is a mismatch, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.OngoingStubbingImpl:thenAnswer`** - This method is used to define the behavior of a mock when a method is called. If the stubbing is not set up correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:findAnswerFor`** - This method finds the answer for a given invocation. If it fails to find the correct answer, it could lead to the `UnsupportedOperationException` seen in the stack trace.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:hasInvocationForPotentialStubbing`** - This method checks if there are any invocations that can be stubbed. If this check fails, it could lead to issues in stubbing behavior.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:addAnswer`** - This method adds an answer to the invocation container. If the answer is not added correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n8. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.InvocationContainerImpl:setInvocationForPotentialStubbing`** - This method sets the invocation for potential stubbing. If this is not set correctly, it could lead to issues in how invocations are handled.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 63, 19, 18, 50, 20, 58, 54]\n}\n```"
