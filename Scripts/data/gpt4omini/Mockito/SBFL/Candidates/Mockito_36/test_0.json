    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation:callRealMethod()`** - This method is directly involved in calling the real method on a mock object, which is where the `NoSuchMethodError` is being thrown. This indicates that the method being called does not exist, leading to a runtime failure.\n\n2. **`org.mockito.internal.creation.AbstractMockitoMethodProxy:invokeSuper()`** - This method is responsible for invoking the super method of a mocked class. If the method being called does not exist in the superclass, it could lead to the same error.\n\n3. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke()`** - This method is part of the CGLIB proxy mechanism used by Mockito to call real methods on mocks. If the method signature is incorrect or the method does not exist, it could also lead to the `NoSuchMethodError`.\n\n4. **`org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod:invoke()`** - Similar to the previous method, this one filters the invocation and calls the real method. Any issues in method resolution could lead to the same error.\n\n5. **`org.mockito.Mockito:when()`** - This method is used to set up the behavior of the mock. If the setup is incorrect, it could lead to the invocation of a non-existent method.\n\n6. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.OngoingStubbingImpl:thenAnswer()`** - This method is used to define what happens when a method is called on a mock. If the answer provided leads to a call to a non-existent method, it could also be a source of the error.\n\n7. **`org.mockito.internal.stubbing.MockitoStubber:addAnswer()`** - This method adds an answer to a stubbed invocation. If the answer leads to a call to a method that does not exist, it could cause the error.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 17, 7, 13]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further investigated to determine the root cause of the `NoSuchMethodError` encountered during the test execution."
