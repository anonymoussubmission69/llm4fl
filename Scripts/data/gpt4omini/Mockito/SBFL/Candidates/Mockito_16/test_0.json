    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldAllowStubbingMocksConfiguredWithRETURNS_MOCKS` is attempting to mock a method using Mockito's `when()` function, but it fails with a `MissingMethodInvocationException`. This indicates that the method being stubbed is not a valid method call on a mock object.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `when()` method in the Mockito library, which is crucial for stubbing behavior. The error suggests that the method being stubbed may not be properly configured or is not a valid method call.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the Mockito library, particularly those related to stubbing and mocking behavior. The methods that are most relevant to the failure include:\n   - `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:stub()Lorg/mockito/internal/progress/IOngoingStubbing;`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMocks:answer(Lorg/mockito/invocation/InvocationOnMock;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMocks:returnValueFor(Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n   - `org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:missingMethodInvocation()V`\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the stubbing process and are likely candidates for further investigation to understand why the test is failing.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [12, 13, 14, 1, 0, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nIn this JSON:\n- `12` corresponds to `org.mockito.Mockito:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;`\n- `13` corresponds to `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:when(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lorg/mockito/stubbing/OngoingStubbing;`\n- `14` corresponds to `org.mockito.internal.MockitoCore:stub()Lorg/mockito/internal/progress/IOngoingStubbing;`\n- `1` corresponds to `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMocks:answer(Lorg/mockito/invocation/InvocationOnMock;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n- `0` corresponds to `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMocks:returnValueFor(Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/Object;`\n- `2` corresponds to `org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter:missingMethodInvocation()V` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
