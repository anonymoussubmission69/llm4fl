"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMath280` is testing the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class. The test expects a specific result (2.0) for the input probability (0.9772498680518209).\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `MathException` occurred due to a `ConvergenceException`, which suggests that the method failed to converge within the allowed iterations.\n3. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method is part of the `AbstractContinuousDistribution` class, which is likely where the convergence logic is implemented.\n4. The `cumulativeProbability` method is also called within `inverseCumulativeProbability`, which could be contributing to the failure if it does not return expected results.\n5. The `logGamma` and `regularizedGammaP` methods are also involved in the calculations related to the normal distribution and could be potential sources of error.\n\nBased on the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `inverseCumulativeProbability` (method_id: 26)\n- `cumulativeProbability` (method_id: 6)\n- `logGamma` (method_id: 0)\n- `regularizedGammaP` (method_id: 17)\n- `Gamma:erf` (method_id: 1)\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 6, 17, 26]\n}\n```"
