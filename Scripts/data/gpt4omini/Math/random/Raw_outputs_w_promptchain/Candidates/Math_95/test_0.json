"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` is attempting to create an instance of `FDistributionImpl` and call its `inverseCumulativeProbability` method. \n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to invalid endpoint parameters, specifically mentioning `lowerBound=0.0`, `initial=-1.0`, and `upperBound=1.7976931348623157E308`.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `bracket` from `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`\n   - `inverseCumulativeProbability` from `AbstractContinuousDistribution`\n   - `inverseCumulativeProbability` from `FDistributionImpl`\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `FDistributionImpl`, `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`, and other related classes. The methods that are most likely to be suspicious and need further analysis are:\n\n1. `bracket` in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` - This method is responsible for finding the bounds for the root-finding algorithm, and the exception suggests that the parameters passed to it are invalid.\n2. `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `FDistributionImpl` - This method is directly involved in the computation that leads to the exception.\n3. `getInitialDomain` in `FDistributionImpl` - This method is used to determine the initial domain for the probability, which could be related to the invalid parameters.\n4. `setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` in `FDistributionImpl` - This method sets the degrees of freedom, which could affect the calculations in `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 6, 2, 10]\n}\n``` \n\nHere, the method IDs correspond to:\n- 1: `bracket` in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`\n- 6: `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `FDistributionImpl`\n- 2: `getInitialDomain` in `FDistributionImpl`\n- 10: `setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` in `FDistributionImpl`"
