"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChiSquare` is failing due to an assertion error related to the chi-square test statistic. The expected value was `9.023307936427388`, but the actual value returned was `16.413107036160778`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the chi-square statistic.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potential candidates for further investigation:\n\n1. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic. Since the test is failing on the chi-square statistic, this method is highly suspicious.\n2. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method also involves the chi-square calculation and is directly related to the test that is failing.\n3. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if the expected values are positive, which is a prerequisite for the chi-square calculation.\n4. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - This method checks if the observed values are non-negative, which is also a prerequisite for the chi-square calculation.\n5. **`setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)`** - This method sets the degrees of freedom for the chi-square distribution, which is crucial for the calculation.\n6. **`cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is used in the chi-square test to calculate the cumulative probability, which is part of the chi-square test statistic calculation.\n\nGiven the relationships and the nature of the failure, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 3, 11, 12, 4, 17]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the chi-square test."
