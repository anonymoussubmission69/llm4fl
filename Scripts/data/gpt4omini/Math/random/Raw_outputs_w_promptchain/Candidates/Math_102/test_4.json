"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failure indicates that the expected chi-square test statistic was not equal to the actual value returned. This suggests that there may be an issue in the calculation of the chi-square statistic, which is likely related to the methods involved in the chi-square test computation.\n\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious based on their involvement in the chi-square test calculation:\n\n1. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is directly responsible for calculating the chi-square test statistic. Any issues in this method could lead to incorrect results.\n2. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method seems to be involved in the calculation of the chi-square value, and any errors here could propagate to the final result.\n3. **`cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is called within the chi-square test calculation and is responsible for computing the cumulative probability, which is critical for determining the test statistic.\n4. **`setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)`** - This method sets the degrees of freedom for the distribution, which is a key parameter in the chi-square test.\n5. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if the expected values are positive, which is a prerequisite for the chi-square test. If it incorrectly identifies values, it could lead to erroneous calculations.\n6. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - Similar to `isPositive`, this method checks if the observed values are non-negative, which is also crucial for the validity of the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 27, 22, 5, 12, 14]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
