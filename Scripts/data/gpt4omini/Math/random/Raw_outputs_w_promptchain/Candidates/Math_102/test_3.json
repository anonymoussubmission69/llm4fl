"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChiSquare` is failing due to an assertion error related to the chi-square test statistic. The expected value was `9.023307936427388`, but the actual value returned was `16.413107036160778`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the chi-square statistic or the parameters being passed to it.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potential candidates for further investigation:\n\n1. **`TestUtils:chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is directly involved in calculating the chi-square statistic.\n2. **`ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for performing the chi-square test, which is likely where the discrepancy arises.\n3. **`ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is also involved in the chi-square calculation and checks for conditions that could affect the result.\n4. **`GammaDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is used in the calculation of probabilities related to the chi-square distribution, which could affect the final result.\n5. **`Gamma:regularizedGammaP(double a, double x)`** - This method is involved in the computation of the regularized gamma function, which is used in statistical calculations.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is important to analyze these methods to understand how the calculations are performed and where the discrepancy might be occurring.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 25, 1, 6]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method IDs**: \n  - `0`: `TestUtils:chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`\n  - `3`: `ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`\n  - `25`: `ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`\n  - `1`: `GammaDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(double x)`\n  - `6`: `Gamma:regularizedGammaP(double a, double x)` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
