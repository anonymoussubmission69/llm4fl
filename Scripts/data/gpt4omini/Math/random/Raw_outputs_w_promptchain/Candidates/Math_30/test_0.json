"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBigDataSet` is failing due to an assertion that checks if the result of the `mannWhitneyUTest` method is greater than 0.1. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `MannWhitneyUTestTest` class, specifically at line 113, which corresponds to the assertion.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include several methods from the `MannWhitneyUTest` class and its dependencies. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **MannWhitneyUTest:mannWhitneyUTest([D[D)D (method_id: 9)** - This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for calculating the Mann-Whitney U statistic and its p-value.\n2. **MannWhitneyUTest:mannWhitneyU([D[D)D (method_id: 8)** - This method calculates the U statistic, which is crucial for the test's outcome.\n3. **MannWhitneyUTest:ensureDataConformance([D[D)V (method_id: 18)** - This method ensures that the input data conforms to expected formats and could be a source of issues if the data is not valid.\n4. **NaturalRanking:rank([D)[D (method_id: 16)** - This method ranks the data, which is a critical step in the Mann-Whitney U test.\n5. **NaturalRanking:restoreNaNs([DLjava/util/List;)V (method_id: 3)** - This method handles NaN values in the ranking process, which could affect the results if not handled correctly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [9, 8, 18, 16, 3]\n}\n```"
