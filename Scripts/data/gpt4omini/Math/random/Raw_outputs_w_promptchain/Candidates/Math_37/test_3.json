"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testTan()` is failing due to an assertion that expected a certain value but received `NaN` (Not a Number). This indicates that there is likely an issue in the computation of the tangent function for complex numbers, specifically in the `tan()` method of the `Complex` class.\n\nThe stack trace points to the `assertEquals` method, which suggests that the comparison of the expected and actual results is where the failure occurs. The `tan()` method is directly involved in this computation, and it calls other mathematical functions that could also be contributing to the issue.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several mathematical functions from the `FastMath` utility class, which are used in the computation of sine and cosine, as well as the `tan()` method itself. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`tan()`** - This is the method being tested directly and is likely where the fault originates.\n2. **`sin()`** - This method is called within the `tan()` method and could be returning an unexpected value.\n3. **`cos()`** - Similar to `sin()`, this method is also called within `tan()` and could be contributing to the `NaN` result.\n4. **`cosh()`** - This method is used in the computation of the tangent for complex numbers and could also be a source of error.\n5. **`sinQ()`** and **`cosQ()`** - These methods are used for more precise calculations of sine and cosine and could be involved in the propagation of the error.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [13, 4, 9, 14, 10, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nHere, the method IDs correspond to:\n- `13`: `tan()`\n- `4`: `sin()`\n- `9`: `cos()`\n- `14`: `cosh()`\n- `10`: `cosQ()`\n- `7`: `polySine()` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure."
