"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath785` is failing due to an issue with the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `FDistribution` class. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when trying to calculate the inverse cumulative probability, which suggests that the methods involved in this calculation are likely to be the source of the problem.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This method is directly involved in the calculation that is failing.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:cumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method to compute the cumulative probability, which is essential for the inverse calculation.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:log(D)D`** - This method is used for logarithmic calculations, which may be involved in the probability calculations.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:exp(D)D`** - Similar to the log method, this method is used for exponential calculations, which may also be relevant.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getNumericalVariance()D`** - This method is used to get the variance, which could affect the calculations in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom()D`** - This method retrieves the numerator degrees of freedom, which is a parameter in the F-distribution and could influence the outcome of the calculations.\n7. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()D`** - Similar to the numerator, this method retrieves the denominator degrees of freedom, which is also critical for the calculations.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [19, 26, 20, 49, 5, 30, 21]\n}\n```"
