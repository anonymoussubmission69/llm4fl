"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testArrayEquals` is designed to test the `equals` method of the `MathUtils` class, specifically for arrays of doubles. The test fails at the assertion that checks if two arrays containing `Double.NaN` are considered equal.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `assertTrue` assertion, which suggests that the `equals` method is returning an unexpected result when comparing arrays that include `Double.NaN`.\n3. The `equals` method for arrays (`MathUtils.equals(double[] x, double[] y)`) is the primary suspect since it is directly involved in the failing test case.\n4. The `equals` method for individual doubles (`MathUtils.equals(double x, double y)`) is also relevant because it is called within the array comparison method and handles the comparison logic for `Double.NaN`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be examined further are:\n\n- `MathUtils.equals(double[] x, double[] y)` (method_id: 0)\n- `MathUtils.equals(double x, double y)` (method_id: 1)\n\nThese methods should be analyzed to determine why the comparison involving `Double.NaN` is not behaving as expected.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
