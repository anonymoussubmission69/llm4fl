"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is focused on the `lcm` (Least Common Multiple) method from the `MathUtils` class. The test is failing because it expects an `ArithmeticException` when calling `MathUtils.lcm(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 1)`, but it does not receive this exception.\n\n2. The `lcm` method checks for zero values and returns zero if either input is zero. However, it does not handle the case where the inputs are extreme values like `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which could lead to an overflow when calculating the LCM.\n\n3. The `gcd` (Greatest Common Divisor) method is called within the `lcm` method, and it also has checks for zero values. However, it does not seem to handle negative values or extreme cases properly, which could propagate issues to the `lcm` method.\n\n4. The `mulAndCheck` method is responsible for checking the multiplication of two integers to ensure it does not overflow. This method is crucial because the LCM calculation involves multiplication, and if it does not handle overflow correctly, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `MathUtils.lcm(int a, int b)` - The primary method under test that is failing.\n- `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)` - This method is called within `lcm` and could contribute to the failure.\n- `MathUtils.mulAndCheck(int x, int y)` - This method checks for overflow during multiplication, which is critical for the LCM calculation.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
