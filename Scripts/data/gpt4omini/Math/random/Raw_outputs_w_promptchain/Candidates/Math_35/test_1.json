"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChromosomeListConstructorTooHigh` is designed to check if an exception is thrown when an invalid elitism rate (1.25) is provided to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The stack trace indicates that an `OutOfRangeException` was expected but not thrown, suggesting that the validation logic in the constructor may not be functioning as intended.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `ListPopulation` constructor, which checks if the size of chromosomes exceeds the population limit.\n2. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor, which calls the `ListPopulation` constructor and sets the elitism rate.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- The `ListPopulation` constructor, as it contains logic that could lead to the exception being thrown if the conditions are not met.\n- The `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor, as it directly interacts with the `ListPopulation` constructor and sets the elitism rate.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
