"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed because it expected a value of `2.5` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with a calculation that is resulting in a Not-a-Number (NaN) value. \n\nThe stack trace points to the `SummaryStatisticsTest.testOverrideMeanWithMathClass` method, which suggests that the failure is related to the calculation of the mean or some statistical operation.\n\nNext, I will analyze the covered methods by the failed test to identify which methods might be suspicious and could lead to the fault.\n\n### Suspicious Methods Analysis:\n1. **Mean:evaluate** - This method calculates the mean of a set of values. If any of the values are NaN or if the sample size is zero, it could lead to a NaN result.\n2. **Sum:evaluate** - This method sums up the values. If it encounters NaN values during summation, it could also result in NaN.\n3. **SumOfLogs:increment** - This method increments the sum of logs. If it tries to log a non-positive number, it could lead to NaN.\n4. **SummaryStatistics:addValue** - This method adds a value to the statistics. If the value being added is NaN, it could propagate through the calculations.\n5. **SummaryStatistics:getMean** - This method retrieves the mean, which is directly related to the failure.\n6. **Mean:getResult** - This method retrieves the result of the mean calculation, which could also be NaN if the underlying calculations are incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to find the fault:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 9, 27, 3, 4]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are directly involved in the calculations that could lead to a NaN result, and analyzing them will help identify the root cause of the failure."
