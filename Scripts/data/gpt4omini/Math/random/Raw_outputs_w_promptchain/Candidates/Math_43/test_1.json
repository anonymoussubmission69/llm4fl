"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion error where the expected value was `2.213363839400643`, but the actual value was `NaN`. This indicates that somewhere in the computation, a value was not valid (likely due to a mathematical operation that resulted in `NaN`).\n\nThe stack trace points to the method `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` in the `SummaryStatisticsTest` class, which suggests that the geometric mean calculation is involved in the failure. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various statistical calculations, particularly those related to logarithmic and geometric mean calculations.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math.util.FastMath:log(D)D`** - This method computes the logarithm, which can return `NaN` if the input is negative or zero.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.summary.SumOfLogs:increment(D)V`** - This method increments the sum of logs, which could lead to `NaN` if it tries to log a non-positive number.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.GeometricMean:getResult()D`** - This method returns the result of the geometric mean calculation, which can return `NaN` if the number of logs is not greater than zero.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics:addValue(D)V`** - This method adds a value to the statistics, which could indirectly lead to `NaN` if it calls methods that do not handle invalid inputs properly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a failure in one could propagate through the others, leading to the final `NaN` result.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 28, 8, 5]\n}\n```"
