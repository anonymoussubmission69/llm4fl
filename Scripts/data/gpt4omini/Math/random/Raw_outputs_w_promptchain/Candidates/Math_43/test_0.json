"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion error where the expected value was `1.25` but the actual value was `NaN`. This indicates that somewhere in the code, a calculation is resulting in `NaN`, which is often caused by invalid operations such as division by zero or taking the logarithm of a negative number.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various statistical calculations, including mean, variance, and logarithmic functions. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math.util.FastMath:log(D)D`** - This method is directly related to logarithmic calculations, which can produce `NaN` if the input is non-positive.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance:evaluate([DII)D`** - This method calculates variance and could potentially lead to `NaN` if the input data is invalid.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Mean:evaluate([DII)D`** - Similar to variance, if the mean calculation encounters invalid data, it could also result in `NaN`.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.summary.SumOfLogs:increment(D)V`** - This method increments a sum of logarithms, which could also lead to `NaN` if it tries to log a non-positive number.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.summary.Sum:evaluate([DII)D`** - This method evaluates a sum and could also be involved in producing `NaN` if the input is invalid.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they are part of the statistical calculations that the test is likely validating. If any of these methods are producing `NaN`, it could propagate through the calculations leading to the final assertion failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 14, 2, 32, 9]\n}\n```"
