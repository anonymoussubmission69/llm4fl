"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` is failing due to an assertion that expected a specific geometric mean value but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the geometric mean, which is being handled by the `GeometricMean` class and its associated methods.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`getGeometricMean()`** (Method ID: 2) - This method retrieves the geometric mean and is directly involved in the failing assertion.\n2. **`evaluate(double[] values, int begin, int length)`** in `SumOfLogs` (Method ID: 22) - This method is responsible for calculating the sum of logarithms, which is crucial for the geometric mean calculation.\n3. **`getResult()`** (Method ID: 8) - This method returns the result of the geometric mean calculation and contains a condition that returns `Double.NaN` if the number of logs is not greater than zero.\n4. **`increment(double d)`** in `SumOfLogs` (Method ID: 28) - This method increments the sum of logs and could be contributing to the issue if it is not correctly handling the input values.\n5. **`addValue(double value)`** (Method ID: 5) - This method adds a value to the statistics and calls several increment methods, including those that affect the geometric mean.\n6. **`setGeoMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic geoMeanImpl)`** (Method ID: 29) - This method sets the implementation for the geometric mean and may be involved in the setup of the test.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the propagation of the fault resulting in the `NaN` value.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 22, 8, 28, 5, 29]\n}\n```"
