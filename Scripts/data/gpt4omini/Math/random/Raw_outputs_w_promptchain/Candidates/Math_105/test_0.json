"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSSENonNegative` is designed to check that the sum of squared errors calculated by the `SimpleRegression` class is non-negative. The test fails with an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the assertion `reg.getSumSquaredErrors() >= 0.0` is not satisfied.\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test include:\n\n1. **Constructor of `SimpleRegression`**: This method initializes the regression object. If there are issues with the initialization, it could lead to incorrect calculations later.\n   \n2. **`addData(double x, double y)`**: This method is responsible for adding data points to the regression model. If there is a bug in how data is added or how the internal state is updated, it could affect the sum of squared errors.\n\n3. **`getSumSquaredErrors()`**: This method calculates and returns the sum of squared errors. If there is a fault in the calculation logic, it would directly lead to the failure of the test.\n\nGiven that the failure is related to the sum of squared errors, the most suspicious methods to analyze further are `addData` and `getSumSquaredErrors`, as they are directly involved in the computation that the test is validating.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nIn conclusion, all three methods are potential candidates for the fault, with a particular focus on `addData` and `getSumSquaredErrors` for deeper investigation."
