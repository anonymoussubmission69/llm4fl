"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **CMAESOptimizer:doOptimize()** - This method is responsible for the optimization process and is likely where the failure occurs, as it directly relates to the test case.\n2. **CMAESOptimizer:checkParameters()** - This method checks the parameters before optimization, and any issues here could propagate to the optimization process.\n3. **CMAESOptimizer:initializeCMA()** - This method initializes the CMA (Covariance Matrix Adaptation) algorithm, which is crucial for the optimization process.\n4. **CMAESOptimizer:parseOptimizationData()** - This method processes the optimization data, and any errors in parsing could lead to incorrect behavior during optimization.\n5. **FitnessFunction:value()** - This method computes the fitness value, which is essential for determining the success of the optimization.\n6. **FitnessFunction:repair()** - This method repairs the solution if it goes out of bounds, which is critical for maintaining valid solutions during optimization.\n7. **CMAESOptimizer:push()** - This method is used to maintain a history of fitness values, and any issues here could affect the optimization process.\n8. **CMAESOptimizer:sortedIndices()** - This method sorts indices based on fitness values, which is important for selecting the best solutions.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could lead to failures in others, especially in the context of optimization algorithms.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [51, 121, 22, 1, 109, 9, 6, 95]\n}\n```"
