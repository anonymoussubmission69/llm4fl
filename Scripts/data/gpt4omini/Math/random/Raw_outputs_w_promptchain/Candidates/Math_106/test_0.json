"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` is designed to check the parsing of a string representation of a fraction. The test expects a `ParseException` to be thrown when an invalid minus sign is encountered in the input string. The failure indicates that the exception was not thrown as expected, suggesting that there may be an issue in the parsing logic.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurred in the `parse` method of the `FractionFormat` class, which is responsible for parsing the string input. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various constructors and parsing methods related to `FractionFormat` and `ProperFractionFormat`.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`FractionFormat:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/text/ParsePosition;)Lorg/apache/commons/math/fraction/Fraction;` (method_id: 11)** - This method is directly involved in parsing the input string and is likely where the fault lies.\n2. **`ProperFractionFormat:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/text/ParsePosition;)Lorg/apache/commons/math/fraction/Fraction;` (method_id: 17)** - This method extends the parsing functionality and may also contribute to the issue.\n3. **`FractionFormat:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/apache/commons/math/fraction/Fraction;` (method_id: 15)** - This method is a higher-level parsing method that calls the lower-level parse methods and could be involved in the failure.\n4. **`FractionFormat:getNumeratorFormat()Ljava/text/NumberFormat;` (method_id: 3)** - This method retrieves the format used for parsing the numerator, which may affect how the input is interpreted.\n5. **`FractionFormat:getDenominatorFormat()Ljava/text/NumberFormat;` (method_id: 6)** - Similar to the numerator format, this method retrieves the format for the denominator, which is also crucial for parsing fractions correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [11, 17, 15, 3, 6]\n}\n```"
