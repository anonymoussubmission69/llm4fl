"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath905LargePositive` is designed to compare the results of `FastMath.cosh(x)` and `Math.cosh(x)` for a range of values. The test fails with an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected value was `0.0`, but the actual value was `Infinity`. This suggests that there is a problem with the computation of the hyperbolic cosine function for large positive values.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`FastMath.cosh(double x)`** - This method is directly involved in the computation that is being tested. If it returns `Infinity` for large values of `x`, it could be due to an issue in its implementation.\n2. **`Math.cosh(double x)`** - This is the reference method against which `FastMath.cosh(x)` is being compared. If this method behaves differently for large values, it could indicate a discrepancy in the expected behavior.\n3. **`FastMath.abs(double x)`** - This method is used to calculate the absolute value, which could be relevant if negative values are involved in the calculations.\n4. **`FastMath.ulp(double x)`** - This method is used to determine the unit in the last place, which could be relevant in the context of floating-point precision and could affect the results of the hyperbolic functions.\n5. **`FastMath.max(double a, double b)`** - This method is used to find the maximum of two values, which could be relevant in the context of ensuring that the computed values do not exceed certain limits.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the nature of the failure, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 13, 8, 2, 16]\n}\n``` \n\nIn this JSON object:\n- `1` corresponds to `FastMath.cosh(double x)`.\n- `13` corresponds to `Math.cosh(double x)`.\n- `8` corresponds to `FastMath.abs(double x)`.\n- `2` corresponds to `FastMath.max(double a, double b)`.\n- `16` corresponds to `FastMath.ulp(double x)`. \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
