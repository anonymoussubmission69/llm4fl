"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDoubleValueForLargeNumeratorAndDenominator` is failing because it expected a value of `5.0` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the calculation of the `doubleValue()` method in the `BigFraction` class, particularly when dealing with large values for the numerator and denominator.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Constructor of `BigFraction`**: The constructor checks for null values and handles the case where the denominator is zero. If the denominator is not properly initialized or if there are issues with the values being passed, it could lead to a division by zero or other unexpected behavior.\n\n2. **`MathUtils.checkNotNull`**: This method is used to ensure that the numerator and denominator are not null. If this check fails, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the `BigFraction` class.\n\n3. **`doubleValue()` method**: This method performs the division of the numerator by the denominator. Given that the test is failing with a `NaN` result, this method is critical to analyze, as it directly relates to the calculation that is being tested.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
