"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIntersectionParallel` is designed to check the intersection of two `SubLine` objects. The test expects the intersection to be `null` when the two lines are parallel.\n2. The stack trace indicates a `NullPointerException` occurring in the `toSubSpace` method of the `Line` class, which is called from the `intersection` method of the `SubLine` class.\n3. The `intersection` method of `SubLine` calls the `intersection` method of `Line`, which suggests that the issue may propagate through these methods.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`SubLine.intersection` (method_id: 12)**: This method is directly involved in the intersection logic and is where the test is initiated.\n- **`Line.toSubSpace` (method_id: 2)**: This method is where the `NullPointerException` occurs, indicating a potential issue with how points are being transformed to subspace.\n- **`Line.intersection` (method_id: 6)**: This method is called within the `SubLine.intersection` method and is part of the intersection logic.\n- **`SubLine` constructor (method_id: 24)**: This method initializes the `SubLine` object and may influence how the intersection is calculated.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [12, 2, 6, 24]\n}\n```"
