"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReciprocalZero` is failing because it expected the reciprocal of `Complex.ZERO` to be `Complex.INF`, but it received `Complex.NaN` instead. This indicates that there is a potential issue in the `reciprocal()` method of the `Complex` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **Constructor** (`Complex(double real, double imaginary)`): This method initializes the `Complex` object and sets the `isNaN` and `isInfinite` flags. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to issues in the `reciprocal()` method.\n   \n2. **equals(Object other)**: This method checks for equality between two `Complex` objects. While it may not directly relate to the failure, if the `isNaN` flag is not set correctly, it could affect comparisons.\n\n3. **toString()**: This method returns a string representation of the `Complex` object. It is less likely to be related to the failure but is included for completeness.\n\n4. **reciprocal()**: This method is directly responsible for calculating the reciprocal of a `Complex` number. The failure indicates that there is likely a fault in this method, particularly in how it handles the case when both real and imaginary parts are zero.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `reciprocal()`\n- `Complex(double real, double imaginary)`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 0]\n}\n```"
