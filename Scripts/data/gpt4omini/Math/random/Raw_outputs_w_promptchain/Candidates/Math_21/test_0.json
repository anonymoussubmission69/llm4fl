"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMath789` is designed to validate the behavior of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class, specifically its `getRootMatrix` method. The test fails when comparing the norm of the difference between the original matrix and the rebuilt matrix, indicating a potential issue in the matrix decomposition or reconstruction process.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs during an assertion that checks if the norm of the difference is zero. The actual value returned is `0.0180652917341963`, which suggests that there is a discrepancy in the matrix operations.\n\n3. The methods involved in the test include matrix creation, multiplication, transposition, and norm calculation. Any of these methods could potentially lead to the observed failure.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n1. **`RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()`** - This method is directly involved in obtaining the root matrix from the decomposition.\n2. **`AbstractRealMatrix.multiply(RealMatrix)`** - This method is used to multiply matrices, which is crucial in the reconstruction of the original matrix.\n3. **`AbstractRealMatrix.subtract(RealMatrix)`** - This method is used to compute the difference between the original and rebuilt matrices.\n4. **`AbstractRealMatrix.getNorm()`** - This method calculates the norm of the matrix, which is the basis for the assertion in the test.\n5. **`MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix(double[][])`** - This method is responsible for creating the matrices used in the test.\n\n### JSON Object with Method IDs:\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 23, 13, 17, 25]\n}\n``` \n\nIn this JSON object:\n- `10` corresponds to `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()`\n- `23` corresponds to `AbstractRealMatrix.multiply(RealMatrix)`\n- `13` corresponds to `AbstractRealMatrix.subtract(RealMatrix)`\n- `17` corresponds to `AbstractRealMatrix.getNorm()`\n- `25` corresponds to `MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix(double[][])`\n\nThese methods are critical to the functionality being tested and should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure."
