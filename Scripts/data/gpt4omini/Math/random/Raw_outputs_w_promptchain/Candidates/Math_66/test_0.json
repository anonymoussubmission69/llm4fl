"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testQuinticMinStatistics` is designed to test the optimization of a quintic function using the `BrentOptimizer`. The test checks the mean of the optimized values, the median iteration count, and the median evaluation count.\n2. The failure occurred in the assertion that checks if the mean optimized value is within a specific range, indicating that the optimization process may not be yielding the expected results.\n3. The stack trace indicates that the failure is related to the `assertEquals` method, which compares the expected value with the actual value returned by the `getEvaluations()` method of the `BrentOptimizer`.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **BrentOptimizer:optimize** - This method is responsible for performing the optimization and could be where the logic fails.\n- **BrentOptimizer:localMin** - This method is likely involved in finding local minima, which is critical for the optimization process.\n- **AbstractUnivariateRealOptimizer:computeObjectiveValue** - This method computes the objective value for the function being optimized, and any issues here could lead to incorrect evaluations.\n- **DescriptiveStatistics:getMean** - This method calculates the mean of the values, which is directly related to the failing assertion.\n- **DescriptiveStatistics:getEvaluations** - This method returns the number of evaluations, which is also part of the failing assertion.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 7, 41, 1, 47]\n}\n```"
