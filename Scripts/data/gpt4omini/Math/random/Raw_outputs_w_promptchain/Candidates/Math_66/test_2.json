"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testQuinticMin` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected result does not match the actual result. The expected value is `-0.2719561270319131`, but the actual value returned is `-0.2719561299044896`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with the optimization process or the function being optimized.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`optimize`** (method_id: 11) - This method is responsible for performing the optimization. Any issues in the optimization logic could lead to incorrect results.\n2. **`getOptimaValues`** (method_id: 4) - This method retrieves the optimal values computed. If the computation of these values is incorrect, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n3. **`localMin`** (method_id: 6) - This method is likely involved in finding local minima, which is crucial for the optimization process. Any errors here could propagate and affect the final result.\n4. **`computeObjectiveValue`** (method_id: 24) - This method computes the value of the function being optimized. If this computation is incorrect, it would directly affect the optimization results.\n5. **`getOptima`** (method_id: 20) - Similar to `getOptimaValues`, this method retrieves the computed optima and could also be a source of error if the optima are not computed correctly.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following JSON object summarizes the potentially suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 6, 11, 20, 24]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
