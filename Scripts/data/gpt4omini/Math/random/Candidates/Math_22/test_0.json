    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion that expected a value of `false` but received `true`. This indicates that there is a logical error in the code being tested, specifically in the method `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()` of the `FDistribution` class, which is expected to return `false` but is returning `true`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `FastMath` and `FDistribution` classes, among others. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`** - This method is directly related to the test failure.\n2. **`log(D[D)D`** - This method is a mathematical function that could be involved in calculations leading to the result.\n3. **`floor(D)D`** - Another mathematical function that might be used in the calculations.\n4. **`log1p(D)D`** - This method also performs logarithmic calculations and could be relevant.\n5. **`logBeta(DDDI)D`** - This method is involved in beta function calculations, which might be related to the distribution.\n6. **`density(D)D`** - This method calculates the density of the distribution, which could be directly related to the test case.\n\nThese methods are interconnected through mathematical operations and could potentially propagate the fault from one method to another.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [9, 0, 1, 4, 5, 21]\n}\n``` \n\nIn this JSON object:\n- `9` corresponds to `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`\n- `0` corresponds to `log(D[D)D`\n- `1` corresponds to `floor(D)D`\n- `4` corresponds to `log1p(D)D`\n- `5` corresponds to `logBeta(DDDI)D`\n- `21` corresponds to `density(D)D` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
