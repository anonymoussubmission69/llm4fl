    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSSENonNegative` is designed to check that the sum of squared errors calculated by the `SimpleRegression` class is non-negative. The test fails with an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the assertion `reg.getSumSquaredErrors() >= 0.0` is not satisfied.\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test include:\n\n1. **Constructor of `SimpleRegression`**: This method initializes the regression object. If there are issues with the initialization, it could lead to incorrect calculations later.\n   \n2. **`addData(double x, double y)`**: This method is responsible for adding data points to the regression model. If there is a flaw in how data is added or how the internal state is updated, it could affect the sum of squared errors.\n\n3. **`getSumSquaredErrors()`**: This method calculates and returns the sum of squared errors. Since the test directly checks the output of this method, it is crucial to analyze it for potential faults.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is likely that the issue lies in how data is being added or how the sum of squared errors is computed. Therefore, all three methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
