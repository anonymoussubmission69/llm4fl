    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIssue716` is attempting to solve a mathematical problem using the `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver`. The test fails due to a `TooManyEvaluationsException`, which indicates that the maximum evaluation count (100) was exceeded during the solving process.\n\n2. The stack trace points to several methods in the `BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver` and `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver` classes, particularly:\n   - `incrementEvaluationCount()`\n   - `computeObjectiveValue(double point)`\n   - `doSolve()`\n   - `solve(int maxEval, UnivariateFunction f, double min, double max, double startValue)`\n\n3. The methods involved in the failure are likely related to the evaluation count and the solving process, which suggests that the logic for managing evaluations and the conditions under which the solver operates may need to be examined.\n\n4. The methods that are directly related to the failure and should be analyzed further include:\n   - `incrementEvaluationCount()`\n   - `computeObjectiveValue(double point)`\n   - `doSolve()`\n   - `setup(int maxEval, UnivariateFunction f, double min, double max, double startValue)`\n   - `solve(int maxEval, UnivariateFunction f, double min, double max, double startValue)`\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [15, 25, 2, 0, 29]\n}\n``` \n\nHere, the method IDs correspond to:\n- `incrementEvaluationCount()` (ID: 15)\n- `computeObjectiveValue(double point)` (ID: 25)\n- `doSolve()` (ID: 2)\n- `setup(int maxEval, UnivariateFunction f, double min, double max, double startValue)` (ID: 0)\n- `solve(int maxEval, UnivariateFunction f, double min, double max, double startValue)` (ID: 29) \n\nThese methods are critical in understanding why the evaluation limit was exceeded and how the solver is functioning."
