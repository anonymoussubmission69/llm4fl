    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBadEndpoints` is designed to check the behavior of the `BrentSolver` when provided with invalid intervals or non-bracketing values. The test expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown in these cases. The failure occurred when the test expected an exception for a non-bracketing scenario, indicating that the method responsible for validating the input intervals is likely faulty.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`verifyInterval(double lower, double upper)`** - This method is responsible for checking if the provided interval is valid. If the interval is invalid (e.g., lower >= upper), it should throw an exception. This is directly related to the test case that failed.\n\n2. **`BrentSolver:solve(UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max)`** - This method calls `verifyInterval` and is responsible for solving the function within the given bounds. If the bounds are invalid, it should trigger the exception.\n\n3. **`verifySequence(double lower, double initial, double upper)`** - This method checks if the sequence of values is valid. It is called in the overloaded `solve` method that takes three parameters. If the sequence is invalid, it should also throw an exception.\n\n4. **`BrentSolver:solve(UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double initial, double max)`** - This method is another variant of the `solve` method that also checks for valid sequences and could be related to the failure.\n\n5. **`MathRuntimeException:createIllegalArgumentException(String pattern, Object... args)`** - This method is responsible for creating the `IllegalArgumentException`. While it may not be directly related to the logic of the solver, it is involved in the exception handling.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 4, 5, 11]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test case."
