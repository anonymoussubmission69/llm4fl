The test `testDigitLimitConstructor` is designed to test the `Fraction` class, specifically its constructor that takes a double value and attempts to convert it into a fraction. The test fails due to a `FractionConversionException`, indicating that there was an overflow while trying to convert a double to a fraction.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the constructor of the `Fraction` class, which is where the overflow occurs. The relevant methods involved in this process include the constructor of `Fraction`, the `FractionConversionException`, and potentially methods related to mathematical operations that could lead to overflow.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include:\n   - `FractionConversionException` constructor\n   - `Fraction` constructor\n   - `FastMath.floor` method\n   - `FastMath.abs` method\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 0**: `FractionConversionException` constructor - This method is directly involved in handling the overflow exception.\n- **Method ID 2**: `Fraction` constructor - This method is where the conversion from double to fraction occurs and is likely the source of the overflow.\n- **Method ID 5**: `FastMath.floor` - This method is used in the `Fraction` constructor and could be contributing to the overflow.\n- **Method ID 11**: `FastMath.abs` - This method is also used in the `Fraction` constructor and could be involved in calculations leading to overflow.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 5, 11]\n}\n```"
