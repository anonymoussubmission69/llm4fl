The test `testMinimizeMaximize` is designed to test the optimization functionality of the `MultiDirectional` class, specifically its ability to minimize and maximize a function with known local and global extrema.\n2. The test fails at line 103, which indicates that an assertion related to the number of evaluations performed by the optimizer is not met. This suggests that the optimizer may not be functioning as expected, possibly due to issues in the evaluation logic or convergence checking.\n3. The stack trace indicates that the failure is related to the `assertTrue` method, which checks the number of evaluations against expected bounds.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`MultiDirectional:optimize(...)`** - This method is responsible for performing the optimization and is central to the test's functionality.\n2. **`MultiDirectional:evaluateNewSimplex(...)`** - This method evaluates a new simplex, which is crucial for the optimization process.\n3. **`MultiDirectional:iterateSimplex(...)`** - This method iterates over the simplex, which is essential for the optimization algorithm's convergence.\n4. **`SimpleScalarValueChecker:converged(...)`** - This method checks if the optimization has converged, which is critical for determining when to stop the optimization process.\n5. **`DirectSearchOptimizer:getEvaluations()`** - This method retrieves the number of evaluations, which is directly related to the failing assertion in the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 3, 22, 7, 5]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
