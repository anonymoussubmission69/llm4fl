    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMath280` is testing the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class. The test expects a specific result (2.0) for the input probability (0.9772498680518209).\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `MathException` occurred due to a `ConvergenceException`, which suggests that the method did not converge within the allowed iterations.\n3. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method is part of the `AbstractContinuousDistribution` class, which is likely where the convergence logic is implemented.\n4. The `cumulativeProbability` method is also called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, which could be contributing to the issue if it does not return expected results.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `NormalDistributionImpl` (method_id: 26)\n- `cumulativeProbability` in `NormalDistributionImpl` (method_id: 6)\n- `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `AbstractContinuousDistribution` (method_id: 12)\n- `bracket` in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` (method_id: 21) - since it is involved in finding roots which is critical for convergence.\n- `logGamma` in `Gamma` (method_id: 0) - as it is used in the calculation of probabilities and could affect the results.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 12, 21, 0, 26]\n}\n```"
