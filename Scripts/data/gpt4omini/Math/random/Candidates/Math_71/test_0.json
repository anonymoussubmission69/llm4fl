Any issues here could propagate through the integration process.\n3. **FirstOrderDifferentialEquations:computeDerivatives** - This is the user-defined method that computes the derivatives for the specific differential equations being solved. If there is an error in the implementation of this method, it could lead to incorrect results.\n4. **DormandPrince853Integrator:estimateError** - This method estimates the error of the integration step, which is critical for ensuring the accuracy of the results. If the error estimation is incorrect, it could lead to a failure in the test.\n5. **CombinedEventsManager:evaluateStep** - This method evaluates the step for events, which could affect the integration process if events are not handled correctly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could lead to failures in others, especially in the context of numerical integration.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 21, 50, 49, 43]\n}\n```"
