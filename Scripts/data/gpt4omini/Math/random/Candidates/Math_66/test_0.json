The test `testQuinticMinStatistics` is designed to test the optimization of a quintic function using the `BrentOptimizer`. The test checks the mean of the optimized values, the median iteration count, and the median evaluation count against expected values.\n2. The failure occurred in the assertion that checks the mean optimized value, where the expected value was `1880.5`, but the actual value was `18.0`. This indicates a significant discrepancy, suggesting that the optimization process did not yield the expected results.\n3. The methods involved in the optimization process, particularly those related to the `BrentOptimizer`, `DescriptiveStatistics`, and the evaluation of the quintic function, are critical to investigate.\n\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n1. **BrentOptimizer:optimize** - This method is responsible for performing the optimization and is directly related to the failure.\n2. **BrentOptimizer:localMin** - This method is called during the optimization process and may contain logic that affects the optimization results.\n3. **DescriptiveStatistics:getMean** - This method calculates the mean of the optimized values, which is where the assertion failure occurred.\n4. **DescriptiveStatistics:addValue** - This method is used to add values to the statistics, and any issues here could affect the mean calculation.\n5. **AbstractUnivariateRealOptimizer:getEvaluations** - This method returns the number of evaluations, which is part of the statistics being checked in the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 7, 1, 39, 47]\n}\n```"
