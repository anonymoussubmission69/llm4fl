It is crucial to analyze how it handles the geometrical properties and if it correctly manages the types involved.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.AbstractRegion:getSize()`** - This method is called within the `computeGeometricalProperties()` method. It is important to check how it calculates the size and if it interacts correctly with the attributes of the region.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.threed.PolyhedronsSet$FacetsContributionVisitor:addContribution()`** - This method is responsible for adding contributions to the facets of the polyhedron. It is essential to verify how it handles the contributions and if it correctly manages the types involved.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.AbstractRegion:recurseSides()`** - This method is involved in determining the sides of the region and could be contributing to the incorrect handling of geometrical properties.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.BSPTree:visit()`** - This method is part of the tree traversal and could be affecting how the geometrical properties are computed.\n\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.AbstractRegion:checkPoint()`** - This method checks the position of a point relative to the region and could be involved in the faulty logic leading to the exception.\n\n7. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.AbstractRegion:insertCuts()`** - This method is responsible for inserting cuts into the region and could be related to how the geometrical properties are defined.\n\n8. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.AbstractRegion:characterize()`** - This method characterizes the region based on its cuts and could be involved in the faulty logic.\n\n9. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.BSPTree:insertCut()`** - This method is responsible for inserting cuts into the BSP tree and could be related to the faulty behavior.\n\n10. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.BoundaryAttribute:getPlusOutside()`** - This method retrieves the plus outside attribute and could be involved in the faulty logic.\n\nThe methods listed above are interconnected, and analyzing them will help identify the root cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [51, 56, 155, 30, 77, 175, 82, 147, 71, 211]\n}\n```"
