    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testExtremeValues` is designed to test the `cumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistribution` class with extreme values of `x`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `MaxIterationsExceededException` was thrown, which suggests that the method `regularizedGammaP` in the `Gamma` class is likely involved in a computation that exceeds the maximum number of iterations allowed.\n3. The `cumulativeProbability` method calls the `erf` method, which in turn calls `regularizedGammaP`. This indicates a chain of method calls that could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. `Gamma:regularizedGammaP(DDDI)D` - This method is directly responsible for the exception being thrown due to exceeding the maximum iterations.\n2. `Erf:erf(D)D` - This method calls `regularizedGammaP`, and any issues in its parameters or logic could propagate the fault.\n3. `NormalDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D` - This method is the entry point for the test and directly calls `erf`, making it crucial to analyze.\n4. `NormalDistributionImpl:setMean(D)V` and `NormalDistributionImpl:setStandardDeviation(D)V` - These methods set the parameters for the distribution and could affect the behavior of `cumulativeProbability`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 1, 7, 13, 6]\n}\n``` \n\n- `2` corresponds to `Gamma:regularizedGammaP(DDDI)D`\n- `1` corresponds to `Erf:erf(D)D`\n- `7` corresponds to `NormalDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D`\n- `13` corresponds to `NormalDistributionImpl:setMean(D)V`\n- `6` corresponds to `NormalDistributionImpl:setStandardDeviation(D)V`"
