It is crucial to check how it handles the bounds and the optimization logic.\n2. **CMAESOptimizer$FitnessFunction:value** - This method is responsible for calculating the fitness value, which is critical for the optimization process. Any issues here could lead to incorrect results.\n3. **CMAESOptimizer:checkParameters** - This method checks the parameters before optimization. If there are any issues with the parameters, it could lead to out-of-bounds errors.\n4. **CMAESOptimizer:initializeCMA** - This method initializes the CMA-ES algorithm. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to invalid optimization results.\n5. **CMAESOptimizer:repairAndDecode** - This method is responsible for repairing and decoding the parameters. If it does not handle out-of-bounds values correctly, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n6. **CMAESOptimizer:penalty** - This method calculates penalties for out-of-bounds values. If it does not function correctly, it could lead to the optimizer returning invalid results.\n7. **CMAESOptimizer:randn1** - This method generates random numbers for the optimization process. If the random generation is flawed, it could affect the optimization results.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [27, 55, 86, 120, 85, 8, 4]\n}\n```"
