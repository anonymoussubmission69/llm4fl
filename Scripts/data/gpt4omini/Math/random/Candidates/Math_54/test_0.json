This indicates that there is likely an issue with how zero values are being handled in the `Dfp` class or its related methods.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their potential involvement in the calculation that led to the unexpected `-Infinity` result:\n\n1. **`Dfp:getZero()`** - This method is expected to return a zero value, which is directly related to the test's assertion.\n2. **`DfpField:getZero()`** - This method is called by `Dfp:getZero()` and is responsible for providing the zero value.\n3. **`Dfp:newDfp(double)`** - This method is used to create a new `Dfp` instance with a value of `0.0`, which is also part of the test.\n4. **`Dfp:divide(int)`** - This method is involved in division operations, and if it is not handling zero correctly, it could lead to `-Infinity`.\n5. **`Dfp:toDouble()`** - This method converts the `Dfp` value to a double, and if the internal representation is incorrect, it could return `-Infinity`.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 54, 7, 6, 47]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to determine how they handle zero values and whether there are any logical errors that could lead to the observed failure in the test."
