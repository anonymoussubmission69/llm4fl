The test `testFullRank` is designed to validate the behavior of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class, specifically checking the properties of the matrix operations involved in the Cholesky decomposition.\n2. The test fails at the assertion `Assert.assertTrue(root.subtract(base).getNorm() > 0.3);`, indicating that the computed root matrix does not differ significantly from the original base matrix, which suggests a potential issue in the matrix operations or the decomposition logic.\n3. The stack trace points to the `RectangularCholeskyDecompositionTest.testFullRank` method, which indicates that the fault may lie within the methods involved in matrix operations, particularly those related to the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in matrix operations:\n\n1. **RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.<init>** - Constructor that initializes the decomposition.\n2. **RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix** - Method that retrieves the root matrix.\n3. **AbstractRealMatrix.subtract** - Method that performs matrix subtraction.\n4. **AbstractRealMatrix.getNorm** - Method that calculates the norm of the matrix.\n5. **AbstractRealMatrix.multiply** - Method that performs matrix multiplication.\n6. **MatrixUtils.checkMultiplicationCompatible** - Utility method that checks if two matrices can be multiplied.\n\nThese methods are critical in the context of the test and may propagate faults through their interactions.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 33, 12, 17, 23, 26]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes the method IDs of the suspicious methods that need further analysis to identify the fault in the system under test."
