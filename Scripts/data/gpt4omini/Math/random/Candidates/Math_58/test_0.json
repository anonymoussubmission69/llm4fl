The exception indicates that a parameter was not strictly positive, which suggests that this method may be where the fault originates.\n3. **LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer.doOptimize()** - This method is part of the optimization process and may be involved in the calculations that lead to the invalid parameters.\n4. **CurveFitter.fit()** - This method is responsible for fitting the curve and may also be involved in the parameter validation.\n5. **CurveFitter.addObservedPoint()** - This method adds observed points to the fitting process and could be related to how data is being processed before fitting.\n6. **BaseAbstractVectorialOptimizer.computeObjectiveValue()** - This method computes the objective value for the optimization process and may be involved in the calculations leading to the exception.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and the fault may propagate through them, especially since the exception indicates a problem with parameter validation.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [53, 67, 37, 33, 66, 35]\n}\n```"
