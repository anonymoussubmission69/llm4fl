    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideMeanWithMathClass` is failing because it expected a mean value of `2.5` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the mean, which is being handled by the `Mean` class and its associated methods.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the mean calculation:\n\n1. **Mean:evaluate** - This method is responsible for evaluating the mean of the values. If it returns `NaN`, it indicates a problem in the logic of this method.\n2. **SummaryStatistics:getMean** - This method retrieves the mean value from the `meanImpl`. If `meanImpl` is not set correctly or if it returns `NaN`, this method will also lead to the failure.\n3. **Mean:getResult** - This method returns the result of the mean calculation. If the underlying moment is not calculated correctly, it could return `NaN`.\n4. **SummaryStatistics:addValue** - This method adds a value to the statistics. If there is an issue in how values are being added or if the mean implementation is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect mean calculations.\n5. **Mean:setMeanImpl** - This method sets the implementation for calculating the mean. If this is not set correctly, it could lead to the mean being calculated incorrectly.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 3, 4, 7, 25]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
