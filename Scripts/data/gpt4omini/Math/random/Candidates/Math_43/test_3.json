    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` is failing due to an assertion that compares the expected geometric mean with the actual result, which is returning `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the geometric mean.\n\nThe stack trace points to the `getGeometricMean()` method in the `SummaryStatistics` class, which calls `geoMeanImpl.getResult()`. The `geoMeanImpl` is set to an instance of `GeometricMean`, which suggests that the problem may lie within the `GeometricMean` class, particularly in its `getResult()` method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods that are involved in the calculation of the geometric mean, including:\n\n1. `getGeometricMean()` - This method retrieves the geometric mean.\n2. `getResult()` in `GeometricMean` - This method returns the result of the geometric mean calculation.\n3. `increment()` in `SumOfLogs` - This method increments the sum of logs, which is crucial for calculating the geometric mean.\n4. `evaluate()` in `SumOfLogs` - This method evaluates the sum of logs, which is also critical for the geometric mean calculation.\n5. `log()` in `FastMath` - This method computes the logarithm, which is used in the geometric mean calculation.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `getGeometricMean()` (Method ID: 2)\n- `getResult()` (Method ID: 8)\n- `increment()` in `SumOfLogs` (Method ID: 28)\n- `evaluate()` in `SumOfLogs` (Method ID: 22)\n- `log()` in `FastMath` (Method ID: 30)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 8, 28, 22, 30]\n}\n```"
