    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideVarianceWithMathClass` is failing due to an assertion that expected a variance value of `1.25` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of variance within the methods involved in the `SummaryStatistics` and `Variance` classes.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Variance:evaluate** - This method is responsible for calculating the variance and is directly involved in the computation that led to the `NaN` result.\n2. **SummaryStatistics:addValue** - This method adds values to the statistics and calls the variance calculation, which could be contributing to the issue.\n3. **SummaryStatistics:getVariance** - This method retrieves the variance, and if the variance calculation is incorrect, it will return `NaN`.\n4. **Variance:getResult** - This method returns the result of the variance calculation, which is `NaN` in this case.\n5. **Variance:clear** - This method clears the state of the variance calculation, which might affect subsequent calculations if not handled properly.\n6. **Mean:evaluate** - This method is used in the variance calculation and could potentially be returning an incorrect mean value, leading to the `NaN` variance.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 5, 29, 24, 30, 36]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be investigated to determine the root cause of the failure in the test."
