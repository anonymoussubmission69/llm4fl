    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion error where the expected value was `2.213363839400643`, but the actual value was `NaN`. This indicates that somewhere in the code, a calculation is resulting in a `NaN` (Not a Number) value, which is often caused by invalid mathematical operations such as taking the logarithm of a negative number or zero.\n\nThe stack trace points to the method `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` in the `SummaryStatisticsTest` class, which suggests that the issue is related to the geometric mean calculation. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various statistical calculations, particularly those related to logarithmic operations and geometric means.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math.util.FastMath:log(D)D`** - This method is responsible for calculating the logarithm, which could lead to `NaN` if the input is non-positive.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.summary.SumOfLogs:increment(D)V`** - This method increments the sum of logs, and if it receives a non-positive value, it could lead to `NaN`.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.GeometricMean:getResult()D`** - This method returns the result of the geometric mean calculation, which could return `NaN` if the underlying sum of logs is not valid.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics:addValue(D)V`** - This method adds a value to the statistics, and if it adds a non-positive value, it could affect the geometric mean calculation.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.summary.SumOfLogs:evaluate([DII)D`** - This method evaluates the sum of logs for an array of values, and if any of those values are non-positive, it could lead to `NaN`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 5, 22]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the `NaN` value being returned in the test."
