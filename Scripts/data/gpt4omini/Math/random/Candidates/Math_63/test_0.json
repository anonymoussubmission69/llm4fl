    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testArrayEquals()` is designed to test the `equals` method of the `MathUtils` class for arrays of doubles. The test fails at the assertion that checks if two arrays containing `Double.NaN` are equal.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `assertFalse` assertion, which suggests that the `equals` method is returning `true` when it should return `false` for the comparison of two `Double.NaN` values.\n3. The `equals(double[] x, double[] y)` method is responsible for handling the comparison of double arrays, and it calls the `equals(double x, double y)` method for individual double comparisons.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- `MathUtils.equals(double[] x, double[] y)` (method_id: 0)\n- `MathUtils.equals(double x, double y)` (method_id: 1)\n\nBoth methods are critical in determining the equality of double arrays, especially in handling special cases like `Double.NaN`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
