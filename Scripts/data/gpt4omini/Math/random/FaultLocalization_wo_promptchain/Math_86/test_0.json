    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and the stack trace, the test `testNotPositiveDefinite()` is failing due to an expected exception `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException`. This suggests that the issue is likely related to the matrix operations being performed, particularly in the context of the Cholesky decomposition.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method is part of the Cholesky decomposition implementation and checks for positive definiteness of the matrix.
