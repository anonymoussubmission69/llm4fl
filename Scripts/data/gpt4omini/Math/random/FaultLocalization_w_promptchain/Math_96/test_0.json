The expected value is `new Complex(0,-1)` and the actual value is `new Complex(0,1)`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the multiplication of complex numbers, specifically in the `multiply` method or related methods that affect the result.\n\nHere is the analysis of the methods and their ranking based on suspiciousness:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The multiply method is directly involved in the operation that leads to the test failure.
