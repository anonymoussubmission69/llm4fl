    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test failure indicates that the `sample()` method is returning a negative value, which is not expected. This suggests that the issue likely originates from the `inverseCumulativeProbability()` method, which is called within `sample()`. \n\n2. The `inverseCumulativeProbability()` method has checks for the range of `p`, but if `p` is not properly bounded (e.g., if `random.nextDouble()` returns a value outside the expected range), it could lead to invalid results. \n\n3. The `calculateNumericalVariance()` method, while important, seems less directly related to the immediate test failure since it deals with variance calculations rather than sampling directly.\n\n4. The constructor for `HypergeometricDistribution` initializes the distribution but does not directly influence the test failure unless it initializes with incorrect parameters.\n\n5. The `getSupportLowerBound()` method is a simple getter and is unlikely to be the source of the test failure.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **Method ID 14 (sample)**: Ensure that the random value passed to `inverseCumulativeProbability()` is properly bounded between 0 and 1. This can be done by adding a check before calling the method.\n  \n- **Method ID 18 (inverseCumulativeProbability)**: Add additional checks to handle edge cases more robustly, especially for values of `p` that are very close to 0 or 1.\n\n- **Method ID 21 (calculateNumericalVariance)**: Ensure that the population size, number of successes, and sample size are valid before performing calculations to avoid division by zero.\n\n- **Method ID 3 (constructor)**: Validate the parameters passed to the constructor to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.\n\n- **Method ID 8 (getSupportLowerBound)**: No changes needed as it is a simple getter.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\n1. **Method ID 18**: Most suspicious due to potential invalid results from `inverseCumulativeProbability()`.\n2. **Method ID 14**: Next suspicious as it directly calls the problematic method.\n3. **Method ID 21**: Less suspicious but still important to validate inputs.\n4. **Method ID 3**: Constructor should validate parameters but is less likely to cause immediate failure.\n5. **Method ID 8**: Least suspicious as it is a simple getter.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
