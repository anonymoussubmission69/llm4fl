    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method ID 1**: This method checks if the mean (p) is less than or equal to zero and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. This is directly related to the test failure when a negative mean is provided. Therefore, it remains the most suspicious.\n\n2. **Method ID 3**: This method creates an `IllegalArgumentException` but does not contain any logic that could lead to a failure in the test. It is related to exception handling but is not directly responsible for the test failure. It should remain in the second position.\n\n3. **Method ID 7**: This method is a constructor that calls another constructor with default values. It does not contain any logic that could lead to a failure in the test, making it the least suspicious. It remains in the third position.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- **Method ID 1**: The current implementation is correct, but ensure that the test case is properly handling the exception thrown for negative means. No changes are needed here.\n  \n- **Method ID 3**: This method is not directly related to the test failure. However, ensure that the exception message is clear and informative. No changes are needed here.\n\n- **Method ID 7**: This method is simply a constructor delegating to another constructor. No changes are needed here.\n\n### ReRanked Methods:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
