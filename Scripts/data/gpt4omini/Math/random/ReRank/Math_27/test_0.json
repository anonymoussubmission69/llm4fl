    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test case and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test case is failing due to an overflow when multiplying large integers, specifically in the `multiply` method. This leads to incorrect results in the `percentageValue` method, which relies on the output of `multiply`.\n2. The constructor of the `Fraction` class does not handle negative numerators correctly, which could lead to incorrect fraction representation.\n3. The `doubleValue` method could yield incorrect results if the numerator or denominator is incorrect, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure.\n4. The `gcd` method is not directly involved in the failure and is less likely to be the source of the issue.\n\n### Proposed Fixes:\n- **Method 0 (Constructor)**: Ensure that the constructor correctly handles negative numerators and normalizes the fraction representation.\n- **Method 1 (Multiply)**: Implement checks to prevent overflow when multiplying large integers. This can be done by checking if the multiplication of `numerator` and `i` exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.\n- **Method 3 (PercentageValue)**: Since this method relies on the `multiply` method, it will be indirectly affected by the overflow issue. Ensure that it handles cases where the multiplication might overflow.\n- **Method 4 (DoubleValue)**: Ensure that the method checks for zero denominators before performing the division to avoid `ArithmeticException`.\n- **Method 2 (GCD)**: No changes needed as it is not directly involved in the failure.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\n1. **Method 1 (Multiply)**: Most suspicious due to overflow risk.\n2. **Method 3 (PercentageValue)**: Second most suspicious as it relies on the multiply method.\n3. **Method 0 (Constructor)**: Third, due to potential issues with negative numerators.\n4. **Method 4 (DoubleValue)**: Fourth, as it could yield incorrect results but is less likely to be the source of the failure.\n5. **Method 2 (GCD)**: Least suspicious as it is not involved in the failure.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
