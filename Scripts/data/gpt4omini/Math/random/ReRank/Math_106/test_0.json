    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test case and the stack trace, the test failure is due to an invalid minus sign in the input string \"2 -2 / 3\". The methods that are responsible for parsing the input string and handling the minus sign are the most suspicious.\n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n1. **Method 11 (parse)**: This method attempts to parse the input string and handle various cases. It checks for the numerator and handles errors. The handling of the minus sign is crucial here, and if it fails to parse correctly, it could lead to the test failure.\n   \n2. **Method 17 (parse)**: This method extends the functionality of the previous one and includes additional parsing logic for whole numbers and denominators. If the logic for handling invalid inputs is flawed, it could lead to the test not throwing the expected exception.\n\n3. **Method 12 (parseNextCharacter)**: This method is responsible for parsing the next character in the input string. If it does not correctly identify the minus sign or whitespace, it could contribute to the failure of the parsing operation.\n\n4. **Method 19 (parseAndIgnoreWhitespace)**: This method is intended to ignore whitespace during parsing. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure, it still plays a role in the overall parsing logic.\n\n5. **Method 10 (constructor)**: This constructor checks for a zero denominator but does not directly relate to the parsing logic. It is less suspicious in the context of the failing test.\n\n6. **Method 3 (getNumeratorFormat)**: This method simply returns the numerator format and does not involve any parsing logic. It is unlikely to be the cause of the test failure.\n\n7. **Method 6 (getDenominatorFormat)**: Similar to method 3, this method returns the denominator format and does not contribute to the parsing logic. It is not suspicious.\n\n8. **Method 1 (getWholeFormat)**: This method returns the whole format and does not involve any parsing logic. It is the least suspicious in the context of the failing test.\n\n### Proposed Fixes:\n- **Method 11 (parse)**: Ensure that the parsing logic correctly identifies and handles invalid minus signs. Add checks to validate the position of the minus sign in relation to the numerator and denominator.\n  \n- **Method 17 (parse)**: Similar to method 11, ensure that the parsing logic correctly handles invalid inputs, especially when dealing with whole numbers and fractions. Implement error handling to throw exceptions for invalid formats.\n\n- **Method 12 (parseNextCharacter)**: Ensure that this method correctly identifies the minus sign and does not skip it if it is in a valid position. Add checks to handle cases where the minus sign is incorrectly placed.\n\n- **Method 19 (parseAndIgnoreWhitespace)**: Ensure that this method does not interfere with the parsing of valid characters, including the minus sign. It should only ignore whitespace.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\nBased on the analysis and potential fixes, the re-ranked list of methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
