    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideVarianceWithMathClass` is failing due to an assertion that expected a variance value of `1.25` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of variance within the methods involved in the `SummaryStatistics` and `Variance` classes.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Variance:evaluate** - This method is responsible for calculating the variance. If it returns `NaN`, it could be due to improper handling of the input values or an issue in the logic.\n2. **SummaryStatistics:addValue** - This method adds values to the statistics and calls the variance implementation. If the variance implementation is not set correctly or if it encounters an issue, it could lead to `NaN`.\n3. **SummaryStatistics:setVarianceImpl** - This method sets the variance implementation. If the implementation is not set correctly, it could lead to issues in variance calculation.\n4. **Variance:getResult** - This method retrieves the result of the variance calculation. If the internal state is not correctly maintained, it could return `NaN`.\n5. **Mean:evaluate** - This method is used in the variance calculation. If it does not handle the input correctly, it could propagate errors leading to `NaN` in variance.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 5, 6, 24, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
