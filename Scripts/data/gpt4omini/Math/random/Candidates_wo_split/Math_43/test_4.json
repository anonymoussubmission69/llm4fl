    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed because it expected a value of `2.5` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with a calculation that is resulting in a Not-a-Number (NaN) value. \n\nThe stack trace points to the `SummaryStatisticsTest.testOverrideMeanWithMathClass` method, which suggests that the failure is related to the calculation of the mean or some statistical operation.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Mean:evaluate** - This method calculates the mean of a set of values. If any of the values are NaN or if the sample size is zero, it could lead to a NaN result.\n2. **Sum:increment** - This method increments the sum with a new value. If the value being added is NaN, it will propagate to the mean calculation.\n3. **SummaryStatistics:addValue** - This method adds a value to the statistics. If it adds a NaN value, it will affect all subsequent calculations.\n4. **SumOfLogs:increment** - This method increments the sum of logs. If it tries to log a negative number or zero, it could lead to NaN.\n5. **FastMath:log** - This method computes the logarithm. If the input is zero or negative, it will return NaN.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 5, 7, 27, 28]\n}\n```"
