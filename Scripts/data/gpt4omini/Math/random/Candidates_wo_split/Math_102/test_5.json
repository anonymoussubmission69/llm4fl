The expected value does not match the actual value returned by the method, indicating a potential issue in the calculation logic.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the chi-square calculation:\n\n1. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is directly involved in the chi-square test calculation and is likely where the fault originates.\n2. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is also involved in the chi-square calculation and may contribute to the error.\n3. **`setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)`** - This method sets the degrees of freedom, which is crucial for the chi-square distribution and could affect the results if not set correctly.\n4. **`cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is called within the chi-square test method and is responsible for calculating the cumulative probability, which is essential for determining the p-value.\n5. **`regularizedGammaP(double a, double x)`** - This method is used in the calculation of the cumulative probability and could also be a source of error if the parameters are not handled correctly.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 21, 4, 17, 10]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
