The test `testMath288` is failing because the expected value of `10.0` does not match the actual value of `11.5`. This discrepancy indicates that there is likely an issue in the optimization process or the constraints being applied.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `SimplexSolver` and `SimplexTableau` classes, which are involved in the optimization process. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods from these classes, as well as methods related to matrix operations.\n\n3. The methods that are most likely to be suspicious and warrant further investigation include:\n   - `SimplexSolver:doOptimize()`\n   - `SimplexSolver:doIteration()`\n   - `SimplexTableau:getSolution()`\n   - `SimplexTableau:createTableau()`\n   - `SimplexTableau:getEntry()`\n   - `LinearObjectiveFunction:getValue()`\n   - `LinearConstraint:getValue()`\n   - `MathUtils:compareTo()`\n\nThese methods are critical in the optimization process and could be responsible for the incorrect result.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [46, 36, 23, 31, 35, 12, 13, 29]\n}\n```"
