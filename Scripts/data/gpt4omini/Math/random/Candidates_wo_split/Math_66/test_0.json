The test `testQuinticMinStatistics` is designed to test the optimization of a quintic function using the `BrentOptimizer`. The test checks the mean of the optimized values, the median iteration count, and the median evaluation count.\n2. The failure occurred in the assertion that checks if the mean optimized value is within a specific range, indicating that the optimization process may not be yielding the expected results.\n3. The stack trace indicates that the failure is related to the `assertEquals` method, which compares the expected value with the actual value returned by the optimization process.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **BrentOptimizer:optimize** (method_id: 14): This method is responsible for performing the optimization and is directly related to the failure.\n- **BrentOptimizer:localMin** (method_id: 7): This method is likely involved in finding the local minimum, which is crucial for the optimization process.\n- **AbstractUnivariateRealOptimizer:computeObjectiveValue** (method_id: 41): This method computes the objective value for the function being optimized, which could affect the optimization results.\n- **DescriptiveStatistics:getMean** (method_id: 1): This method calculates the mean of the values, which is directly related to the assertion that failed.\n- **DescriptiveStatistics:addValue** (method_id: 39): This method adds values to the statistics, which could influence the mean calculation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 7, 14, 39, 41]\n}\n```"
