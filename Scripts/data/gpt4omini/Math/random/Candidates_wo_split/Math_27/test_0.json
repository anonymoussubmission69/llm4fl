    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath835` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected value does not match the actual value returned by the `percentageValue()` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is specifically designed to check for overflow issues, which suggests that the methods involved in the calculation of the fraction and its percentage value are critical to investigate.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **Fraction Constructor (`Fraction:<init>(II)V`)**: This method initializes a fraction with a numerator and denominator. If there is an issue with how fractions are created, it could lead to incorrect values being used in calculations.\n\n2. **Multiply Method (`Fraction:multiply(I)Lorg/apache/commons/math3/fraction/Fraction;`)**: This method multiplies the fraction by an integer. If the multiplication is not handled correctly, it could lead to overflow or incorrect fraction values.\n\n3. **GCD Method (`ArithmeticUtils:gcd(II)I`)**: This method calculates the greatest common divisor. If the GCD is not calculated correctly, it could affect the simplification of fractions, leading to incorrect results.\n\n4. **Percentage Value Method (`Fraction:percentageValue()D`)**: This method calculates the percentage value of the fraction. Since the test is directly comparing the output of this method, it is crucial to analyze it for any potential issues.\n\n5. **Double Value Method (`Fraction:doubleValue()D`)**: This method converts the fraction to a double. If there are issues in how the double value is calculated, it could lead to inaccuracies in the percentage calculation.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n```"
