    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath785` is failing due to an issue with the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `FDistribution` class. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when trying to calculate the inverse cumulative probability, which suggests that the methods involved in this calculation may be faulty.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This is the method directly involved in the test that is failing. It is responsible for calculating the inverse cumulative probability.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:cumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method to compute the cumulative probability, which is essential for the inverse calculation.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getNumericalVariance()D`** - This method is used to get the variance, which may affect the calculations in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom()D`** - This method retrieves the numerator degrees of freedom, which is likely used in the calculations of both cumulative and inverse cumulative probabilities.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()D`** - Similar to the numerator, this method retrieves the denominator degrees of freedom, which is also crucial for the calculations.\n\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:log(D)D`** - This method is used for logarithmic calculations, which may be involved in the probability calculations.\n\n7. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:exp(D)D`** - This method is used for exponential calculations, which may also be involved in the probability calculations.\n\n8. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.ContinuedFraction:evaluate(DDI)D`** - This method is part of the continued fraction calculations, which may be relevant if the inverse cumulative probability relies on such calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [19, 26, 51, 30, 21, 49, 48, 17]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
