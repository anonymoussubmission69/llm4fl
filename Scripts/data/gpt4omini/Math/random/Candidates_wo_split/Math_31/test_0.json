The exception indicates that the continued fraction diverged to NaN, which suggests a potential issue in the evaluation logic.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta:regularizedBeta(DDD)D`**: This method is called within the `cumulativeProbability` method of the `BinomialDistribution`, which is part of the test. If the continued fraction evaluation fails, it could affect the results of the regularized beta function.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistribution:cumulativeProbability(I)D`**: This method is responsible for calculating the cumulative probability, and it calls the `regularizedBeta` method. If there is an issue in the beta calculation, it could lead to incorrect cumulative probabilities.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.AbstractIntegerDistribution:solveInverseCumulativeProbability(DII)I`**: This method is involved in solving the inverse cumulative probability, which is part of the logic that could be affected by the previous methods.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)I`**: This method is also part of the inverse cumulative probability logic and could be impacted by the issues in the cumulative probability calculations.\n\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistribution:getNumericalVariance()D`**: This method calculates the variance, which is a fundamental statistical property that could be affected by the underlying issues in the distribution calculations.\n\n7. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistribution:getNumericalMean()D`**: Similar to variance, the mean is also a critical statistical property that could be influenced by the problems in the distribution calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 8, 11, 19, 23, 24, 3]\n}\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the direct involvement in the stack trace and their relationships to the methods that could propagate the fault."
