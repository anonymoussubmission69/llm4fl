The test `testPValueNearZero` is designed to check the behavior of the `PearsonsCorrelation` class, specifically the method `getCorrelationPValues()`, which is expected to return a matrix of p-values for the correlation coefficients.\n2. The assertion that failed indicates that the p-value returned for the correlation between the first two variables is not greater than zero, which suggests that there may be an issue in the calculation of the correlation or the p-values.\n3. The stack trace points to the `PearsonsCorrelationTest` class, specifically at line 181, which is where the assertion is made.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n- `PearsonsCorrelation:getCorrelationPValues()`\n- `PearsonsCorrelation:correlation([D[D)D`\n- `SimpleRegression:addData(DD)V`\n- `SimpleRegression:getR()D`\n- `TDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D`\n- `TDistributionImpl:setDegreesOfFreedom(D)V`\n- `BlockRealMatrix:getEntry(II)D`\n- `BlockRealMatrix:getColumn(I)[D`\n- `BlockRealMatrix:getRowDimension()I`\n\nThese methods are involved in the computation of the correlation and the p-values, and any issues in their implementation could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 30, 16, 25, 41, 15, 10, 22, 3]\n}\n```"
