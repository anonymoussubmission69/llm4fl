    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSSENonNegative` is designed to check that the sum of squared errors calculated by the `SimpleRegression` class is non-negative. The test fails with an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the assertion `reg.getSumSquaredErrors() >= 0.0` is not satisfied.\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test are:\n1. `SimpleRegression` constructor (`SimpleRegression:<init>()V`)\n2. `addData(double x, double y)` - This method is responsible for adding data points to the regression model.\n3. `getSumSquaredErrors()` - This method calculates the sum of squared errors.\n\n### Reasoning for Suspicion:\n- **`getSumSquaredErrors()`**: This method is directly involved in the assertion that failed. If it returns a negative value, it indicates a problem in the calculation of the sum of squared errors.\n- **`addData(double x, double y)`**: This method is responsible for updating the internal state of the regression model with new data points. If there is an issue in how data is added or how the internal variables are updated, it could lead to incorrect calculations in `getSumSquaredErrors()`.\n- **`SimpleRegression` constructor**: While less likely to be the direct cause of the failure, if the constructor does not initialize the internal state correctly, it could lead to issues later when data is added or when calculations are performed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the fault:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
