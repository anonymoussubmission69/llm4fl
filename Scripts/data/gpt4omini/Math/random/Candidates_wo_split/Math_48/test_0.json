The test expected a `ConvergenceException` instead.\n\nThe relevant parts of the stack trace indicate that the failure occurred during the execution of the `solve` method in the `RegulaFalsiSolver`, which is a specific implementation of a univariate real solver. The `solve` method calls `incrementEvaluationCount`, which is responsible for tracking the number of evaluations and throwing the `TooManyEvaluationsException` when the limit is reached.\n\nThe covered methods that are suspicious and need to be analyzed further include:\n\n1. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:solve(...)`** - This method is responsible for solving the function and is where the evaluation count is managed.\n2. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:incrementEvaluationCount()`** - This method increments the evaluation count and throws the `TooManyEvaluationsException` if the maximum count is exceeded.\n3. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:computeObjectiveValue(double)`** - This method computes the value of the function at a given point and calls `incrementEvaluationCount()`.\n4. **`BaseSecantSolver:doSolve()`** - This method is part of the solving process and may contribute to the evaluation count.\n5. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:setup(...)`** - This method sets up the solver, including the maximum evaluation count.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [11, 15, 24, 31, 13]\n}\n```"
