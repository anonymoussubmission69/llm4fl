Any issues here could lead to incorrect event handling.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.ode.AbstractIntegrator:integrate(...)`** - This method is responsible for performing the integration, and any faults here could directly affect the results of the integration.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.ode.nonstiff.DormandPrince853Integrator:integrate(...)`** - This is a specific implementation of the integration method, and since the test is failing in this context, it is essential to analyze it.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.ode.events.EventState:stepAccepted(...)`** - This method is called when a step is accepted, and it handles the event state, which is critical for the correctness of the integration process.\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math3.ode.AbstractIntegrator:sanityChecks(...)`** - This method performs sanity checks before integration, and any failure here could indicate a problem with the input parameters or state.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [16, 84, 20, 89, 39, 1]\n}\n```"
