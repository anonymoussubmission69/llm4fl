The test `testMath789` is designed to validate the behavior of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class, specifically its `getRootMatrix` method. The test fails when comparing the norm of the difference between the original matrix and the rebuilt matrix, indicating a potential issue in the matrix decomposition or reconstruction process.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the assertion that checks if the norm of the difference is equal to 0.0, but it returns a value of approximately 0.018, suggesting that the matrices are not equivalent as expected.\n\n3. The methods involved in the test include:\n   - `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()`\n   - `RealMatrix.subtract(RealMatrix)`\n   - `RealMatrix.multiply(RealMatrix)`\n   - `RealMatrix.getNorm()`\n   - `MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix(double[][])`\n   - `MatrixUtils.checkSubtractionCompatible(AnyMatrix, AnyMatrix)`\n\n4. The methods that are directly related to the failure and need further investigation include:\n   - `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()`: This method is responsible for returning the root matrix after decomposition.\n   - `RealMatrix.subtract(RealMatrix)`: This method is used to compute the difference between the original and rebuilt matrices.\n   - `RealMatrix.multiply(RealMatrix)`: This method is used to multiply matrices, which is crucial in the reconstruction process.\n   - `RealMatrix.getNorm()`: This method calculates the norm of the matrix, which is used in the assertion.\n   - `MatrixUtils.checkSubtractionCompatible(AnyMatrix, AnyMatrix)`: This method checks if the matrices are compatible for subtraction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 12, 13, 17, 33]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 10**: `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()`\n- **Method ID 12**: `RealMatrix.subtract(RealMatrix)`\n- **Method ID 13**: `RealMatrix.multiply(RealMatrix)`\n- **Method ID 17**: `RealMatrix.getNorm()`\n- **Method ID 33**: `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()`\n\nThese methods are critical in the matrix operations that lead to the failure in the test, and further investigation into their implementations may reveal the underlying fault."
