Any errors in this calculation could directly affect the optimization results.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [51, 121, 22, 1, 109]\n}\n```"
