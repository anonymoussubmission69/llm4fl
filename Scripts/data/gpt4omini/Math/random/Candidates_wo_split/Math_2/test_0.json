    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath1021` is failing due to an assertion error indicating that the sampled value is -50, which is outside the expected range of 0 to n (where n is 50). This suggests that there may be an issue with the sampling method or the parameters used in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **HypergeometricDistribution constructor**: This method initializes the distribution with the given parameters. If the parameters are incorrect or lead to an invalid state, it could cause the sampling method to produce invalid results.\n   - Method ID: 3\n\n2. **sample() method**: This method is responsible for generating a sample from the distribution. If there is a bug in the sampling logic, it could lead to invalid sample values.\n   - Method ID: 14\n\n3. **getSupportLowerBound()**: This method returns the lower bound of the support for the distribution. If this is incorrectly implemented, it could affect the validity of the sampled values.\n   - Method ID: 8\n\n4. **getSupportUpperBound()**: Similar to the lower bound, if the upper bound is incorrect, it could also lead to invalid sample values.\n   - Method ID: 17\n\n5. **getPopulationSize()**: This method returns the population size, which is a critical parameter for the distribution. If this value is incorrect, it could lead to erroneous sampling.\n   - Method ID: 20\n\n6. **getNumberOfSuccesses()**: This method returns the number of successes in the population, which is also critical for the distribution's behavior.\n   - Method ID: 23\n\n7. **getSampleSize()**: This method returns the sample size, which is another important parameter for the distribution.\n   - Method ID: 25\n\n8. **calculateNumericalVariance()**: This method calculates the variance of the distribution. If the variance is incorrectly calculated, it could affect the sampling.\n   - Method ID: 21\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potentially suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 14, 8, 17, 20, 23, 25, 21]\n}\n```"
