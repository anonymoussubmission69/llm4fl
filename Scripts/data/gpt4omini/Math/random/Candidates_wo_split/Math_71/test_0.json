Any issues here could propagate through the integration process.\n3. **FirstOrderDifferentialEquations:computeDerivatives** - This is the user-defined method that computes the derivatives for the specific differential equations being solved. If there is an error in the implementation of this method, it could directly affect the integration results.\n4. **DormandPrince853Integrator:estimateError** - This method estimates the error of the integration step, which is critical for ensuring the accuracy of the results. If the error estimation is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect results being returned.\n5. **CombinedEventsManager:evaluateStep** - This method evaluates the step for events, which could affect the integration process if events are not handled correctly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 21, 50, 49, 43]\n}\n```"
