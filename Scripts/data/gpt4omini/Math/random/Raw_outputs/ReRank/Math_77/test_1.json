"Based on the analysis of the test case and the stack trace, the following issues were identified in the methods:\n\n1. **getLInfNorm()**: The method has a logical error where it incorrectly calculates the L-infinity norm. The return statement is inside the loop, causing it to return prematurely after the first iteration. The correct implementation should find the maximum absolute value of the elements in the array.\n\n2. **getNorm()**: Similar to `getLInfNorm()`, this method also has a return statement inside the loop, which causes it to return prematurely. It should sum the squares of the elements and return the square root after the loop.\n\n3. **getL1Norm()**: This method also has a return statement inside the loop, which is incorrect. It should sum the absolute values of the elements and return the sum after the loop.\n\n4. **Constructor**: The constructor simply clones the input array and does not perform any calculations, making it the least suspicious.\n\n### Suggested Fixes\n\n1. **getLInfNorm()**:\n   ```java\n   public double getLInfNorm() {\n       double max = 0;\n       for (double a : data) {\n           max = Math.max(max, Math.abs(a));\n       }\n       return max;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **getNorm()**:\n   ```java\n   public double getNorm() {\n       double sum = 0;\n       for (double a : data) {\n           sum += a * a;\n       }\n       return Math.sqrt(sum);\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **getL1Norm()**:\n   ```java\n   public double getL1Norm() {\n       double sum = 0;\n       for (double a : data) {\n           sum += Math.abs(a);\n       }\n       return sum;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Constructor**: No changes needed.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods\n\nGiven the analysis and the fixes, the re-ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n1. **getLInfNorm()** - Most suspicious due to direct relation to the failing test case.\n2. **getNorm()** - Significant issue but not directly related to the failing test.\n3. **getL1Norm()** - Similar to `getNorm()`, not directly related to the failing test.\n4. **Constructor** - Least suspicious as it does not perform any calculations.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
