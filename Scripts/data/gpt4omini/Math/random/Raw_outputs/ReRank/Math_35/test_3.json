"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method 0 (ElitisticListPopulation constructor)**:\n   - The constructor does not validate the `elitismRate`. The test indicates that an `OutOfRangeException` is expected when the elitism rate is too high (1.25). This suggests that the method should include validation logic to check if the `elitismRate` is within an acceptable range (e.g., between 0 and 1).\n   - **Potential Fix**:\n     ```java\n     public ElitisticListPopulation(final int populationLimit, final double elitismRate) {\n         super(populationLimit);\n         if (elitismRate < 0 || elitismRate > 1) {\n             throw new OutOfRangeException(elitismRate, 0, 1);\n         }\n         this.elitismRate = elitismRate;\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Method 1 (ListPopulation constructor)**:\n   - This constructor checks if the `populationLimit` is less than or equal to zero, which is good. However, it does not handle the elitism rate, which is less directly related to the failing test. Since the test is focused on the `ElitisticListPopulation`, this method is less suspicious in the context of the current failing test.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes are necessary for this method based on the current failing test.\n\n### Re-Ranking\nGiven the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n- Method 0 is still the most suspicious due to the lack of validation for the elitism rate.\n- Method 1 remains less suspicious as it is not directly related to the failing test.\n\n### Final Output\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
