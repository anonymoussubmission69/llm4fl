"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The `ClassCastException` indicates that there is an issue with type casting, specifically with `BoundaryAttribute` being cast to `Boolean`. This suggests that the problem is likely related to how boundary attributes are being handled in the geometrical computations.\n\n2. The methods that are most likely to be involved in this issue are those that deal with geometrical properties and boundary attributes. \n\n### Method Analysis and Potential Fixes\n\n1. **computeGeometricalProperties (ID: 51)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 1\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the visitor (`FacetsContributionVisitor`) correctly handles the types of boundary attributes. Add type checks before casting to prevent `ClassCastException`.\n   - **ReRank**: 1\n\n2. **getSize (ID: 56)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 2\n   - **Potential Fix**: Validate the result of `computeGeometricalProperties()` to ensure it does not lead to unexpected states. Consider adding error handling if the barycenter is null.\n   - **ReRank**: 2\n\n3. **addContribution (ID: 1)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 3\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the contributions being added are of the expected types. Add checks to validate the types of `sub` and `reversed` parameters.\n   - **ReRank**: 3\n\n4. **insertCut (ID: 82)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 4\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the `fitToCell` method correctly handles the hyperplane and does not return an empty cut unexpectedly. Add checks for the validity of the hyperplane.\n   - **ReRank**: 4\n\n5. **visit (ID: 77)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 5\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the visitor is correctly handling the boundary attributes during traversal. Add logging to track the state of the visitor and the nodes being visited.\n   - **ReRank**: 5\n\n6. **recurseBuildBoundary (ID: 76)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 6\n   - **Potential Fix**: Validate the boundary attributes being set. Ensure that the `BoundaryAttribute` is being constructed with valid parameters.\n   - **ReRank**: 6\n\n7. **isEmpty (ID: 69)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 7\n   - **Potential Fix**: This method is less likely to be related to the issue. However, ensure that `remainingRegion` is properly initialized before calling `isEmpty()`.\n   - **ReRank**: 7\n\n8. **rememberPlusFound (ID: 34)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 8\n   - **Potential Fix**: This method is unlikely to be related to the failure. No changes needed.\n   - **ReRank**: 8\n\n### Final Ranking and Output\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 56,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 82,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 69,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
