"Based on the analysis of the test and the retrieved method bodies, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 8**: \n   - **Current Body**: Returns `Double.NaN` if `sumOfLogs.getN() > 0`, which is incorrect logic. It should return `Double.NaN` when `sumOfLogs.getN() <= 0`.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Change the condition to return `Double.NaN` when `sumOfLogs.getN() <= 0`.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 1.\n\n2. **Method ID 2**: \n   - **Current Body**: Retrieves the result from `geoMeanImpl.getResult()`, which can return `NaN` if the conditions in `getResult()` are not met.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that `getResult()` is called only when it is guaranteed to return a valid result, or handle the `NaN` case appropriately.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 2.\n\n3. **Method ID 22**: \n   - **Current Body**: Initializes `sumLog` to `NaN` and only assigns it a value if a test passes. If the test fails, it could lead to `NaN` being returned.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Initialize `sumLog` to `0.0` instead of `NaN` and ensure that it is only used when valid.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 3.\n\n4. **Method ID 28**: \n   - **Current Body**: Increments a value by the logarithm of `d`. If `d` is non-positive, it could lead to issues.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add a check to ensure `d` is positive before performing the logarithm operation.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 4.\n\n5. **Method ID 30**: \n   - **Current Body**: Handles logarithmic calculations and checks for special cases. While it could potentially lead to `NaN`, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure compared to the others.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the input `x` is positive before performing logarithmic calculations.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 5.\n\nBased on the analysis, the ranking remains the same as the original ranking provided. Here is the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
