"Based on the analysis of the test and the retrieved method bodies, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 19: `inverseCumulativeProbability`**\n   - **Analysis**: This method is crucial as it directly calculates the inverse cumulative probability. The test failure indicates that it may not be handling boundary conditions correctly, especially when `p` is 0 or 1. The logic for handling these cases needs to be reviewed.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method correctly handles the cases when `p` is 0 or 1, and verify that the calculations involving `mu` and `sig` are valid and do not lead to NaN or infinite values.\n   \n2. **Method ID 26: `cumulativeProbability`**\n   - **Analysis**: This method computes cumulative probability and is directly linked to the inverse calculation. If it returns incorrect values, it will affect the results of `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Review the calculation of the regularized beta function to ensure that it is correctly implemented and that the parameters passed to it are valid.\n\n3. **Method ID 23: `regularizedBeta`**\n   - **Analysis**: This method is used in the calculation of cumulative probabilities. If there is an issue with how the beta function is calculated, it could lead to incorrect cumulative probabilities.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Check the implementation of the `regularizedBeta` method to ensure it correctly computes the beta function and handles edge cases.\n\n4. **Method ID 30: `getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom`**\n   - **Analysis**: This method simply returns a value used in calculations. If this value is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect results.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Verify that `numeratorDegreesOfFreedom` is set correctly and is not leading to erroneous calculations.\n\n5. **Method ID 21: `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom`**\n   - **Analysis**: Similar to the previous method, it returns a value that could affect calculations.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom` is correctly initialized and used.\n\n6. **Method ID 20: `log`**\n   - **Analysis**: This is a utility function that is less likely to be the source of the problem unless there is an issue with the input values.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Validate the input to ensure it is greater than 0 before calling the log function.\n\n7. **Method ID 49: `exp`**\n   - **Analysis**: This is also a utility function that is less likely to be the source of the problem.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Similar to the log function, ensure that the input is valid.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
