"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 12: `inverseCumulativeProbability`**\n   - **Issue**: The method is not correctly handling the root-finding process, particularly the bounds and the function's behavior. The convergence exception indicates that the method is not finding a root within the specified bounds.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the `bracket` method is called correctly and that the bounds are set appropriately. Additionally, handle cases where the function values at the bounds are very close to zero to avoid convergence issues.\n   - **ReRank**: 1\n\n2. **Method ID 21: `bracket`**\n   - **Issue**: This method is responsible for finding the bounds for the root-finding process. If it fails to correctly bracket the root, it could lead to convergence issues in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Review the logic for adjusting the bounds and ensure that the function values at the bounds are checked correctly. Consider adding more robust checks for the initial values and the maximum iterations.\n   - **ReRank**: 2\n\n3. **Method ID 6: `cumulativeProbability`**\n   - **Issue**: This method is called within `inverseCumulativeProbability`. If it does not return expected values, it could lead to incorrect results in the inverse method.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the calculations for the cumulative probability are accurate, especially for extreme values of `x`. Consider adding checks for edge cases.\n   - **ReRank**: 3\n\n4. **Method ID 0: `logGamma`**\n   - **Issue**: This method does not seem to be directly related to the failure in the test. However, it is a mathematical utility that may be used elsewhere.\n   - **Potential Fix**: While it may not be directly related, ensure that it handles edge cases correctly, such as when `x` is less than or equal to zero.\n   - **ReRank**: 4\n\n5. **Method ID 26: `inverseCumulativeProbability` (alternative implementation)**\n   - **Issue**: This method handles edge cases for `p` being 0 or 1. It is less likely to be the source of the convergence issue since it does not seem to be invoked in the failing test case.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that this method is correctly integrated with the main `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and that it handles edge cases appropriately.\n   - **ReRank**: 5\n\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranked methods are as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
