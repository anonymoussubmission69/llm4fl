"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'inverseCumulativeProbability' is directly involved in the stack trace and is responsible for handling the cumulative probability. The exception indicates that it may not be handling edge cases correctly, particularly when p is 0 or 1, which could lead to invalid parameters being passed to other methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'bracket' method is called in the stack trace and is responsible for setting up the bounds for the function. If the bounds are not set correctly, it could lead to the IllegalArgumentException seen in the stack trace. This method's logic is crucial for ensuring valid inputs.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor for 'FDistributionImpl' initializes the degrees of freedom. If the degrees of freedom are set incorrectly, it could lead to issues in the calculations performed in other methods, including 'inverseCumulativeProbability'.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getInitialDomain' method calculates a value based on the denominator degrees of freedom. If the denominator is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect calculations, but it is less directly related to the exception than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom' method simply returns a value. While it is important for the calculations, it does not contain any logic that could lead to the exception directly. It is the least suspicious method in this context.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
