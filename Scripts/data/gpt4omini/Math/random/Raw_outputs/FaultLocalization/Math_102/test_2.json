"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` is failing because the expected chi-square test statistic does not match the actual computed value. The expected value is `114875.90421929007`, while the actual value returned is `3624883.3429077636`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue in the methods responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic or the degrees of freedom.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method chiSquare computes the chi-square statistic based on the expected and observed values. Given that the test is failing due to a mismatch in the chi-square statistic, this method is highly suspicious as it directly contributes to the calculation that is being tested.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The chiSquareTest method sets the degrees of freedom and calls a cumulative probability function. If the degrees of freedom are incorrectly set, it could lead to an incorrect chi-square statistic. This method is also suspicious as it is part of the overall chi-square calculation process.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The setDegreesOfFreedom method sets the alpha parameter for the gamma distribution. If the degrees of freedom are not set correctly, it could affect the cumulative probability calculation, which in turn affects the chi-square statistic. This method is less suspicious than the previous two but still relevant.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The cumulativeProbability method calls the gamma distribution's cumulative probability function. While it is part of the calculation chain, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure compared to the methods that compute the chi-square statistic.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The isPositive method checks if all elements in the expected array are positive. If this method returns false, it could prevent the chi-square calculation from proceeding correctly. However, it is less directly related to the failure than the methods that compute the statistic.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The isNonNegative method checks if all elements in the observed array are non-negative. Similar to isPositive, it is a validation method and less likely to be the cause of the failure in the chi-square statistic calculation.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
