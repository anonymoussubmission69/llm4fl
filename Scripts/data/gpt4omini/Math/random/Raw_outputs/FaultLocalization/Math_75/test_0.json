"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the failure occurs in the `getPct(Object)` method when it is called with an `Integer` object, leading to an unexpected result. The methods involved in calculating the percentage rely on the frequency counts, which are likely being miscalculated or not properly initialized.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getPct(Comparable<?>) method calculates the percentage based on the frequency count. If the frequency counts are incorrect or not properly initialized, this method will return incorrect results, leading to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getSumFreq() method is responsible for summing the frequencies. If it does not return the correct total frequency, the percentage calculations will be incorrect, directly impacting the results of getPct(Comparable<?>).\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getPct(Object) method calls getCumPct((Comparable<?>) v). If the object passed is not handled correctly, it could lead to incorrect calculations, especially since the test case involves an Integer object.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getCount(Comparable<?>) method retrieves the count for a given value. If the frequency table does not contain the expected values, it will return incorrect counts, affecting the percentage calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getPct(long v) method simply converts a long to a Long and calls another getPct method. It is less suspicious as it does not perform any calculations itself.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Similar to getPct(long v), the getPct(int v) method converts an int to a Long and calls another getPct method. It is less suspicious as it does not perform any calculations itself.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The addValue(int v) method converts an int to a Long and calls another addValue method. It is less suspicious as it does not perform any calculations itself.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The addValue(long v) method is similar to addValue(int v) and does not perform any calculations itself, making it the least suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
