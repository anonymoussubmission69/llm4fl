"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` is designed to check the parsing of a string that represents a fraction. The test expects a `ParseException` to be thrown when an invalid minus sign is encountered in the input string. The stack trace indicates that the test fails because the expected exception is not thrown, leading to an assertion failure.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods to determine their suspiciousness:\n\n1. **Method 11 (parse(String source, ParsePosition pos))**: This method is responsible for parsing the input string into a `Fraction`. It checks for the numerator and handles errors. If it fails to parse the numerator, it sets the error index. This method is crucial for the test's functionality, making it highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Method 17 (parse(String source, ParsePosition pos))**: This method extends the functionality of the previous parse method and includes additional parsing logic for whole numbers and denominators. Given that it is also involved in parsing fractions, it is also very suspicious.\n\n3. **Method 10 (Fraction(int num, int den))**: This constructor initializes a `Fraction` object. It checks for a zero denominator, which is critical for fraction validity. If the denominator is zero, it could lead to an exception. This method is somewhat suspicious but less so than the parsing methods.\n\n4. **Method 12 (parseNextCharacter(String source, ParsePosition pos))**: This method reads the next character from the source string while ignoring whitespace. It is less directly related to the parsing logic that would throw an exception for invalid input, making it less suspicious.\n\n5. **Method 19 (parseAndIgnoreWhitespace)**: This method is used to ignore whitespace in the input string. While it is necessary for parsing, it does not directly contribute to the logic that would cause the test to fail, making it less suspicious.\n\n6. **Method 3 (getNumeratorFormat())**: This method returns the format used for parsing the numerator. It is a simple getter and does not contain any logic that could lead to the test failure.\n\n7. **Method 6 (getDenominatorFormat())**: Similar to method 3, this method returns the format for the denominator. It is also a simple getter and does not contribute to the failure.\n\n8. **Method 1 (getWholeFormat())**: This method returns the format for whole numbers. Like the previous two methods, it is a simple getter and does not contribute to the failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for parsing the input string into a Fraction and handles errors related to parsing.
