However, the implementation has a logical flaw where it returns the sum of the absolute values of u and v when either is zero, which is incorrect. This could lead to unexpected results, as seen in the test case where the expected output was 98304 but the method returned 3440640. The method's handling of zero values and the overall structure suggest it is the source of the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
