"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testAddNonComparable` is designed to check the behavior of the `addValue` method in the `Frequency` class when a non-comparable object is added. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown from the `addValue` method, which suggests that this method is a primary suspect.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `Frequency.<init>()` - The constructor for the `Frequency` class.\n2. `Frequency.addValue(Object v)` - The method that adds a value to the frequency table.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The `addValue` method is directly implicated in the failure, as it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when a non-comparable object is added. This method should be analyzed closely to understand why it fails with the given input.\n- The constructor `Frequency.<init>()` initializes the frequency table but does not directly contribute to the failure. However, it is still relevant as it sets up the state of the `Frequency` object.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- `Frequency.addValue(Object v)` (method_id: 1) - Directly responsible for the failure.\n- `Frequency.<init>()` (method_id: 0) - Relevant for understanding the state of the object but not directly causing the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0]\n}\n```"
