"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testFactorial` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual results of the factorial calculations. The error indicates a discrepancy in the expected value and the computed value for `17!`, which suggests that there may be an issue in the methods responsible for calculating the factorial and its logarithm.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `MathUtils.factorialLog(int n)`\n2. `MathUtils.factorialDouble(int n)`\n3. `MathUtils.factorial(int n)`\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **factorialLog(int n)**: This method computes the logarithm of the factorial. If there is an error in the logarithmic calculation, it could lead to incorrect results in the factorial calculations.\n- **factorialDouble(int n)**: This method computes the factorial as a double. It relies on `factorialLog` for its calculations, so any issues in `factorialLog` could propagate here.\n- **factorial(int n)**: This method computes the factorial as a long. It uses `factorialDouble` for its calculations, meaning any inaccuracies in `factorialDouble` could also affect this method.\n\nGiven the propagation of potential faults from one method to another, all three methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further.\n\n### Conclusion:\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
