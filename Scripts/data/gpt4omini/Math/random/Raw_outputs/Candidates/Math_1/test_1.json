"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testDigitLimitConstructor` is designed to test the `BigFraction` class, specifically its constructor that takes a double value and a maximum denominator.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `FractionConversionException` is thrown due to an overflow when trying to convert a double to a fraction.\n3. The exception is thrown from the `BigFraction` constructor, which suggests that the issue lies within the logic of this constructor or the methods it calls.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n- **`BigFraction.<init>(DDII)`**: This constructor is directly involved in creating a `BigFraction` object and is where the overflow exception originates.\n- **`FractionConversionException.<init>(DJJ)V`**: This method is responsible for throwing the exception, indicating that it is part of the error handling process.\n- **`FastMath.floor(D)D`**: This method is used to calculate the floor of a double value, which is part of the logic in the `BigFraction` constructor.\n- **`BigFraction:<init>(DI)V`**: This constructor is also related to the creation of `BigFraction` and may be involved in the logic that leads to the overflow.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 8, 4, 10]\n}\n``` \n\n- **0**: `FractionConversionException.<init>(DJJ)V` - Exception handling.\n- **8**: `BigFraction.<init>(DDII)` - Directly related to the overflow issue.\n- **4**: `FastMath.floor(D)D` - Used in the `BigFraction` constructor.\n- **10**: `BigFraction:<init>(DI)V` - Related constructor that may contribute to the issue."
