"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **EigenDecompositionImpl.computeShiftIncrement(int, int, int)** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace as the source of the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. It is crucial to analyze how it handles indices and whether it properly checks bounds before accessing arrays.\n\n2. **EigenDecompositionImpl.goodStep(int, int)** - This method is also involved in the stack trace and may be related to the logic that leads to the faulty index access in `computeShiftIncrement`.\n\n3. **EigenDecompositionImpl.processGeneralBlock(int)** - This method is part of the decomposition process and could be indirectly related to the faulty behavior if it affects the state or data used in `computeShiftIncrement`.\n\n4. **EigenDecompositionImpl.decompose()** - This method is responsible for the overall decomposition process and may call the other methods, making it important to check how it orchestrates the calls and manages data.\n\n5. **EigenDecompositionImpl.findEigenvalues()** - This method is involved in finding eigenvalues and may also interact with the methods above, potentially leading to the faulty behavior.\n\n6. **EigenDecompositionImpl.initialSplits(int)** - This method is part of the setup for the decomposition and could influence how the data is structured before it is processed in the other methods.\n\n7. **EigenDecompositionImpl.countEigenValues(double, int, int)** - This method is used to count eigenvalues and may be involved in the logic that leads to the faulty index access.\n\n8. **EigenDecompositionImpl.eigenvaluesRange(int, int)** - This method is responsible for determining the range of eigenvalues and could affect the data used in the decomposition process.\n\nThe methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the stack trace and their potential influence on the faulty behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 37, 11, 13, 34, 26, 10, 30]\n}\n```"
