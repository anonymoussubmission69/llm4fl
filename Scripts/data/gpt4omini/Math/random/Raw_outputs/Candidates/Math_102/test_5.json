"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is failing due to an assertion error in the `chiSquare` method of the `ChiSquareTestImpl` class. The expected value does not match the actual value returned by the method, indicating a potential issue in the calculation logic.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the chi-square calculation:\n\n1. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is directly involved in the chi-square test and is likely where the fault originates.\n2. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic, which is critical to the test.\n3. **`setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)`** - This method sets the degrees of freedom, which is a key parameter in the chi-square distribution.\n4. **`cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is used to compute the cumulative probability, which is part of the chi-square test calculation.\n5. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if the expected values are positive, which is a prerequisite for the chi-square test.\n6. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - This method checks if the observed values are non-negative, which is also a prerequisite for the chi-square test.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 21, 4, 17, 11, 12]\n}\n```"
