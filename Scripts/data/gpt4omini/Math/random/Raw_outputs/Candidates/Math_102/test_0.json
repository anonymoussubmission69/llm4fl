"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failure indicates that the expected chi-square test statistic does not match the actual value computed. This suggests that there may be an issue in the methods responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic or related distributions.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquareTest** - This method is directly responsible for performing the chi-square test and is likely where the discrepancy arises.\n2. **ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquare** - This method also computes the chi-square value and may be involved in the calculation leading to the failure.\n3. **ChiSquaredDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability** - This method is used to compute the cumulative probability, which is part of the chi-square test calculation.\n4. **GammaDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability** - This method is called within the cumulative probability calculation and may affect the outcome.\n5. **Gamma:regularizedGammaP** - This method is involved in the gamma function calculations, which are critical for the chi-square test.\n6. **Gamma:logGamma** - This method computes the logarithm of the gamma function, which is also essential for the calculations in the chi-square test.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could propagate and lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 24, 19, 2, 16, 22]\n}\n```"
