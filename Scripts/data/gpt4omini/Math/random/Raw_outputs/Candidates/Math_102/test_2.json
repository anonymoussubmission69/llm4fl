"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected chi-square test statistic does not match the actual value returned. The test is using the `ChiSquareTestImpl` class to perform the chi-square test, which indicates that the methods involved in the chi-square calculation are likely candidates for investigation.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the chi-square calculation:\n\n1. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is directly responsible for performing the chi-square test and is likely where the fault originates.\n2. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is also involved in the chi-square calculation and may contribute to the discrepancy in the test statistic.\n3. **`setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)`** - This method sets the degrees of freedom for the distribution, which is crucial for the chi-square test.\n4. **`cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is used to calculate the cumulative probability, which is part of the chi-square test logic.\n5. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if the expected values are positive, which is a prerequisite for the chi-square test.\n6. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - This method checks if the observed values are non-negative, another prerequisite for the chi-square test.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, these methods should be analyzed to determine if there are any logical errors or incorrect assumptions that could lead to the observed discrepancy in the test statistic.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 23, 5, 18, 12, 13]\n}\n```"
