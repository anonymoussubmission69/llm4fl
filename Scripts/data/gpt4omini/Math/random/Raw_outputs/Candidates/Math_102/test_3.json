"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChiSquare` is failing due to an assertion error related to the chi-square test statistic. The expected value was `9.023307936427388`, but the actual value returned was `16.413107036160778`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the chi-square statistic or the parameters being passed to it.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`TestUtils:chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is directly involved in calculating the chi-square statistic. Any issues in this method could lead to incorrect results.\n2. **`ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for performing the chi-square test and is called by the `chiSquare` method in `TestUtils`. If there are issues in how the test is conducted, it could affect the outcome.\n3. **`ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method also calculates the chi-square value and has checks for the validity of the input arrays. Any logical errors here could lead to incorrect calculations.\n4. **`GammaDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is used in the chi-square test implementation. If the cumulative probability calculation is incorrect, it could affect the final p-value.\n5. **`Gamma:regularizedGammaP(double a, double x)`** - This method is involved in the computation of the gamma function, which is used in statistical calculations. Errors here could propagate through the calculations.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 25, 1, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
