"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failure indicates that the expected chi-square test statistic was not equal to the actual value returned. This suggests that there may be an issue in the calculation of the chi-square statistic, which is likely related to the methods involved in the chi-square test implementation.\n\nThe following methods are identified as potentially suspicious based on their involvement in the chi-square test calculation:\n\n1. **ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)** - This method is directly responsible for performing the chi-square test and is likely where the discrepancy arises.\n2. **ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)** - This method seems to be a helper method for calculating the chi-square statistic, and any issues here could propagate to the main test method.\n3. **ChiSquaredDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(double x)** - This method is called within the chi-square test implementation and is responsible for calculating the cumulative probability, which is critical for determining the test statistic.\n4. **GammaDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(double x)** - This method is called by the cumulativeProbability method of ChiSquaredDistributionImpl, and any issues in the gamma distribution calculations could affect the final result.\n5. **ChiSquaredDistributionImpl:setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)** - This method sets the degrees of freedom for the distribution, which is crucial for the chi-square test and could lead to incorrect calculations if not set properly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 27, 22, 1, 5]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
