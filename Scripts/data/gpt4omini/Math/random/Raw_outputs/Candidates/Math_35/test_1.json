"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChromosomeListConstructorTooHigh` is designed to check if an exception is thrown when the elitism rate is set too high (1.25 in this case). The expected exception is `org.apache.commons.math3.exception.OutOfRangeException`, which indicates that the elitism rate must be within a certain range (likely between 0 and 1).\n\nThe stack trace shows that the test fails because the expected exception is not thrown, suggesting that the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` does not properly validate the elitism rate.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `ListPopulation` constructor, which checks the size of the chromosomes against the population limit.\n2. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor, which calls the `ListPopulation` constructor.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`ListPopulation` constructor**: This method checks the size of the chromosomes but does not seem to validate the elitism rate.\n2. **`ElitisticListPopulation` constructor**: This method calls the `ListPopulation` constructor and sets the elitism rate, but it does not validate if the elitism rate is within the acceptable range.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth constructors are suspicious as they are involved in the creation of the `ElitisticListPopulation` object and are likely related to the failure of the test. The lack of validation for the elitism rate in the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor is particularly concerning.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
