"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNotPositiveDefinite` is designed to check if a `CholeskyDecomposition` implementation correctly throws a `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` when the input matrix is not positive definite. The stack trace indicates that the expected exception was not thrown, which suggests that there may be an issue in the methods related to the Cholesky decomposition process.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **CholeskyDecompositionImpl constructor**: This method initializes the decomposition and checks if the matrix is square and positive definite. If the matrix is not positive definite, it should throw the `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException`.\n   - Method ID: 14\n\n2. **getL()**: This method retrieves the lower triangular matrix L from the decomposition. If the decomposition has not been performed correctly, this could lead to incorrect results.\n   - Method ID: 13\n\n3. **getLT()**: This method retrieves the transpose of the lower triangular matrix L. Similar to `getL()`, if the decomposition is incorrect, this could also lead to issues.\n   - Method ID: 21\n\n4. **isSquare()**: This method checks if the matrix is square. If the matrix is not square, the decomposition cannot proceed correctly.\n   - Method ID: 16\n\n5. **createRealMatrix()**: This method creates a real matrix from a 2D array. If the input data is not valid, it could lead to issues in the decomposition.\n   - Method ID: 6\n\n6. **checkMultiplicationCompatible()**: This method checks if two matrices can be multiplied. If the dimensions are not compatible, it could lead to runtime exceptions.\n   - Method ID: 1\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 13, 21, 16, 6, 1]\n}\n```"
