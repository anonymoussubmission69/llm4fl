"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath905LargeNegative` is failing due to an assertion that expected a maximum error of `0.0`, but instead received `Infinity`. This suggests that there is an issue with the calculations performed in the methods being tested, particularly those related to hyperbolic functions (`cosh` and `sinh`) and possibly the handling of large negative values.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are therefore suspicious:\n\n1. **`FastMath.cosh(double x)`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the error originates, especially since the test is checking the behavior of `cosh` for large negative values.\n2. **`FastMath.sinh(double x)`** - Similar to `cosh`, this method is also directly tested and could be contributing to the error.\n3. **`FastMath.abs(double x)`** - While not directly causing the error, it is used in the calculation of maximum error and could be involved in how values are processed.\n4. **`FastMath.max(double a, double b)`** - This method is used to determine the maximum error and could be involved in the logic that leads to the assertion failure.\n5. **`FastMath.ulp(double x)`** - This method is used to calculate the unit in the last place and could be relevant in the context of floating-point precision issues that might lead to `Infinity`.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 19, 1, 14, 9]\n}\n```\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Method IDs 4 and 19** (`FastMath.cosh` and `FastMath.exp`) are directly involved in the calculations that lead to the assertion failure.\n- **Method IDs 1, 14, and 9** (`FastMath.abs`, `FastMath.max`, and `FastMath.ulp`) are used in the error calculation and could contribute to the propagation of errors leading to the observed `Infinity` result."
