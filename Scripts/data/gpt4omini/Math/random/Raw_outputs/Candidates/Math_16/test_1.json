"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath905LargePositive` is designed to compare the results of `FastMath.cosh` and `Math.cosh`, as well as `FastMath.sinh` and `Math.sinh`, for large positive values. The test fails with an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected result was `0.0`, but the actual result was `Infinity`. This suggests that there is an issue with the calculations performed by the `FastMath` methods when handling large input values.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`FastMath.cosh(double x)`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the issue arises when handling large values.\n2. **`FastMath.sinh(double x)`** - Similar to `cosh`, this method is also directly involved in the test and could be contributing to the failure.\n3. **`FastMath.abs(double x)`** - This method is used to calculate the absolute value, which may be relevant in the context of handling large numbers.\n4. **`FastMath.ulp(double x)`** - This method is used to determine the unit in the last place, which could be relevant when dealing with precision issues in large calculations.\n5. **`FastMath.max(double a, double b)`** - This method is used to find the maximum of two values, which may be relevant in the context of the calculations being performed.\n\nGiven the context of the failure and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the potentially suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 8, 13, 18]\n}\n```\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Method IDs 1 and 2** are directly related to the failing test as they are the methods being tested (`cosh` and `sinh`).\n- **Method ID 8** (`ulp`) could be relevant due to potential precision issues when dealing with large values.\n- **Method ID 13** (`max`) is included as it may be involved in determining the maximum value during calculations.\n- **Method ID 18** (`exp`) is included as it is a fundamental mathematical operation that could be indirectly related to the calculations performed in `cosh` and `sinh`."
