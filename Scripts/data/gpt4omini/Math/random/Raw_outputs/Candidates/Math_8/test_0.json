"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIssue942` is attempting to sample from a `DiscreteDistribution` created with a list of pairs. The test expects the sample size to be 1, but it fails with an `ArrayStoreException`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurs in the `sample` method of the `DiscreteDistribution` class, specifically at line 190.\n3. The `sample` method is likely trying to store an object of an incompatible type into an array, which is causing the `ArrayStoreException`.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **DiscreteDistribution:sample(int sampleSize)** (method_id: 17): This method is directly involved in the sampling process and is where the exception occurs.\n- **DiscreteDistribution:sample()** (method_id: 19): This method is called within the `sample(int sampleSize)` method and is responsible for returning a single sample.\n- **DiscreteDistribution:<init>(Ljava/util/List;)** (method_id: 6): The constructor initializes the distribution with the provided list of pairs, which may have implications on the types being stored.\n- **Pair:getKey()** (method_id: 2) and **Pair:getValue()** (method_id: 13): These methods are used to retrieve the key and value from the pairs, which are part of the list passed to the `DiscreteDistribution`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 17, 19, 2, 13]\n}\n```"
