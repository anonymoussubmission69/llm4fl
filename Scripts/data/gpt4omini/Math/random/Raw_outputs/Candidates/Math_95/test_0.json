"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` is attempting to create an instance of `FDistributionImpl` with degrees of freedom set to `1.0` for both numerator and denominator. \n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to invalid endpoint parameters, specifically mentioning `lowerBound=0.0 initial=-1.0 upperBound=1.7976931348623157E308`.\n3. The error occurs in the `bracket` method of `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`, which is called during the execution of `inverseCumulativeProbability` in `FDistributionImpl`.\n4. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method is called with a probability value `p` that is derived from the cumulative probability method, which is also part of the `FDistributionImpl`.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`FDistributionImpl:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D`**: This method is directly involved in the computation that leads to the exception.\n- **`UnivariateRealSolverUtils:bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDD)[D`**: This method is where the exception is thrown, indicating a potential issue with the parameters being passed.\n- **`FDistributionImpl:<init>(DD)V`**: The constructor initializes the degrees of freedom, which may be contributing to the invalid parameters.\n- **`FDistributionImpl:getInitialDomain(D)D`**: This method is responsible for determining the initial domain based on the degrees of freedom, which could be related to the invalid input.\n- **`FDistributionImpl:getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()D`**: This method retrieves the denominator degrees of freedom, which is critical in the context of the exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 1, 3, 2, 5]\n}\n```"
