"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion error where the expected value was `1.25`, but the actual value was `NaN`. This indicates that somewhere in the code, a calculation resulted in `NaN`, which is often caused by invalid operations such as division by zero or taking the logarithm of a negative number.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various statistical calculations, including mean, variance, and logarithmic functions. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math.util.FastMath:log(D)D`** - This method is responsible for calculating the logarithm of a number. If the input is negative or zero, it could lead to `NaN`.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance:evaluate([DII)D`** - This method calculates variance and could potentially return `NaN` if the input data is invalid.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Mean:evaluate([DII)D`** - Similar to variance, if the mean calculation encounters invalid data, it could also return `NaN`.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.summary.Sum:evaluate([DII)D`** - This method sums values and could contribute to `NaN` if any of the values are `NaN`.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics:addValue(D)V`** - This method aggregates various statistics and could propagate `NaN` if any of the underlying calculations return `NaN`.\n\nGiven the potential for `NaN` propagation through these methods, they should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 14, 5, 9]\n}\n```"
