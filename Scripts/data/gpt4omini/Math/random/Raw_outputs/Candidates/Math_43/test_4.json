"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed because it expected a value of `2.5` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with a calculation that is resulting in a Not-a-Number (NaN) value. \n\nThe stack trace points to the `SummaryStatisticsTest.testOverrideMeanWithMathClass` method, which suggests that the failure is related to the calculation of the mean or some statistical operation.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Mean:evaluate** - This method calculates the mean and has a division operation that could lead to NaN if the sample size is zero or if the sum is NaN.\n2. **SummaryStatistics:getMean** - This method retrieves the mean value, which could be affected by the underlying calculations in the Mean class.\n3. **Sum:increment** - This method increments the sum, and if it is not handled properly, it could lead to NaN.\n4. **SumOfLogs:increment** - This method uses the FastMath.log method, which could return NaN if the input is non-positive.\n5. **FastMath:log** - This method is directly involved in logarithmic calculations, which can produce NaN if the input is less than or equal to zero.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 3, 5, 27, 28]\n}\n```"
