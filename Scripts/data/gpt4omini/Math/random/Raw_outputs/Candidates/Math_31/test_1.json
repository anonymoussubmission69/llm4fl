"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath785` is failing due to an issue with the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `FDistribution` class. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when trying to calculate the inverse cumulative probability, which suggests that the methods involved in this calculation may be faulty.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This is the method directly involved in the test that is failing.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:cumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method to compute the cumulative probability, which is essential for the inverse calculation.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:log(D)D`** - This method is used for logarithmic calculations, which may be involved in the probability calculations.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:exp(D)D`** - Similar to the log function, this method is used for exponential calculations, which may also be relevant.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta:regularizedBeta(DDD)D`** - This method is likely used in the calculation of probabilities and could affect the results of the cumulative probability.\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom()D`** - This method retrieves a parameter that is likely used in the calculations, and if it returns an incorrect value, it could lead to failures.\n7. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()D`** - Similar to the numerator, this method retrieves another parameter that is crucial for the calculations.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [19, 26, 20, 49, 23, 30, 21]\n}\n```"
