"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath1021` is failing due to an assertion error indicating that the sampled value is -50, which is outside the expected range of 0 to n (where n is 50). This suggests that there is a problem with the sampling method in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several constructors and methods related to the `HypergeometricDistribution`, as well as methods from the `AbstractWell` and `RandomDataImpl` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **HypergeometricDistribution Constructor**: This method initializes the distribution and could be responsible for setting up invalid parameters.\n2. **sample() Method**: This method is directly responsible for generating the sample value, which is where the failure occurs.\n3. **inverseCumulativeProbability() Method**: This method is used in the sampling process and could lead to incorrect sampling if it has issues.\n4. **getSupportLowerBound() and getSupportUpperBound()**: These methods determine the valid range for the samples and could be returning incorrect bounds.\n5. **calculateNumericalVariance()**: This method is involved in calculating variance, which could affect the sampling distribution.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following methods are identified as potentially suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 14, 18, 8, 21]\n}\n``` \n\n- **3**: HypergeometricDistribution constructor\n- **14**: AbstractIntegerDistribution sample method\n- **18**: AbstractIntegerDistribution inverseCumulativeProbability method\n- **8**: HypergeometricDistribution getSupportLowerBound method\n- **21**: HypergeometricDistribution calculateNumericalVariance method\n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
