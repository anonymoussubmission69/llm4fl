"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath835` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected value does not match the actual value returned by the `percentageValue()` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is specifically designed to check for overflow issues when calculating a percentage from a fraction.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **Fraction Constructor (`Fraction(int num, int den)`)**: This method initializes a fraction and checks for a denominator of zero. If the denominator is negative, it calculates the GCD, which could lead to issues if not handled correctly.\n\n2. **Multiply Method (`multiply(int i)`)**: This method multiplies the fraction's numerator by an integer. If the numerator is already large, this could lead to overflow.\n\n3. **GCD Method (`gcd(int p, int q)`)**: This method calculates the greatest common divisor. While it is a utility method, any issues in its implementation could affect the fraction's initialization.\n\n4. **Percentage Value Method (`percentageValue()`)**: This method calculates the percentage value of the fraction. It calls the `multiply` method, which could lead to overflow if the numerator is large.\n\n5. **Double Value Method (`doubleValue()`)**: This method converts the fraction to a double. If the numerator or denominator is not handled correctly, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the potentially suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
