"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is focused on the `lcm` (Least Common Multiple) method from the `MathUtils` class. The test is failing because it expects an `ArithmeticException` when calling `MathUtils.lcm(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 1)`, but it does not receive this exception.\n\n2. The `lcm` method calls the `gcd` method to compute the least common multiple, which means that if there is an issue in the `gcd` method, it could propagate and affect the `lcm` method.\n\n3. The `mulAndCheck` method is also involved in the calculation of `lcm`, as it checks for overflow when multiplying two integers. If there is an issue with how multiplication is handled, it could also lead to incorrect results in the `lcm` method.\n\nGiven these points, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `MathUtils.lcm(int a, int b)` - This is the method directly under test and is expected to throw an exception.\n- `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)` - This method is called within `lcm` and could affect its behavior.\n- `MathUtils.mulAndCheck(int x, int y)` - This method is used to check for overflow during multiplication in `lcm`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
