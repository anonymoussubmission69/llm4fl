"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testGcd()` is designed to test the `gcd` method from the `MathUtils` class. The test is failing specifically when it expects an `ArithmeticException` to be thrown for the input `MathUtils.gcd(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 0)`, but it does not occur, leading to an assertion failure.\n\n2. The covered method identified is `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)`, which is responsible for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The implementation of this method includes checks for zero values and handles negative integers, but it seems to lack proper handling for the case of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` when paired with zero.\n\n3. The failure indicates that the method does not throw the expected exception when it should, suggesting a potential flaw in the logic of the `gcd` method.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious method that needs to be further examined is:\n\n- `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)`\n\nThis method should be scrutinized to ensure it correctly handles edge cases, particularly involving `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The potential suspicious method's ids\n}\n```"
