"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMean()` is designed to check the behavior of the `PoissonDistributionImpl` class when initialized with a negative mean. The expectation is that it should throw a `NotStrictlyPositiveException`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception is thrown in the constructor of `PoissonDistributionImpl`, specifically at line 94, where it checks if the mean (`p`) is less than or equal to zero.\n3. The constructor of `PoissonDistributionImpl` is called with a negative value (-1), which leads to the exception being thrown.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 1**: `PoissonDistributionImpl:<init>(DDI)V` - This is the constructor where the negative mean is being checked. It directly relates to the failure.\n- **Method ID 3**: `MathRuntimeException:createIllegalArgumentException(...)` - This method is responsible for creating the exception that is thrown when the mean is not positive. It is relevant to the error handling in the constructor.\n- **Method ID 7**: `PoissonDistributionImpl:<init>(D)V` - This constructor calls the other constructor with default values, and it is also relevant since it is part of the initialization process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 3, 7]\n}\n```"
