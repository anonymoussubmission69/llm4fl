"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIssue631` is failing due to an unexpected exception: `TooManyEvaluationsException`, which indicates that the maximum number of evaluations allowed for the solver was exceeded. The test expected a `ConvergenceException` instead.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:solve(...)`** - This method is responsible for solving the equation and is where the evaluation count is managed. It directly relates to the failure since it is the entry point for the solving process.\n2. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:incrementEvaluationCount()`** - This method increments the evaluation count and throws a `TooManyEvaluationsException` if the count exceeds the maximum. This is directly related to the exception being thrown.\n3. **`Incrementor:incrementCount()`** - This method is responsible for incrementing the count of evaluations and throwing the `MaxCountExceededException` if the limit is reached. It is crucial to understand how the count is being managed.\n4. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:setup(...)`** - This method sets up the solver, including the maximum evaluation count. If this is not set correctly, it could lead to the `TooManyEvaluationsException`.\n5. **`BaseSecantSolver:doSolve()`** - This method is part of the solving process and may contribute to the evaluation count if it is not converging properly.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [11, 15, 35, 13, 31]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to understand the cause of the failure and to ensure that the evaluation count is being managed correctly within the solver."
