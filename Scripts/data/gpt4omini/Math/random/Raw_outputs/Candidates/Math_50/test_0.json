"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIssue631` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` caused by an expected exception `TooManyEvaluationsException`. This suggests that the method responsible for solving the equation is likely exceeding the maximum number of evaluations allowed.\n\nThe test uses the `RegulaFalsiSolver` to find a root of the function defined in the test. The relevant methods that could be causing the issue are those related to the solving process, particularly those that handle evaluations and the setup of the solver.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods identified for further analysis:\n\n1. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:solve(ILorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDD)D`** - This method is responsible for initiating the solving process and could be where the evaluation count is set.\n2. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:setup(ILorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDD)V`** - This method sets up the solver, including the maximum evaluation count.\n3. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:incrementEvaluationCount()V`** - This method increments the evaluation count and could be directly related to the `TooManyEvaluationsException`.\n4. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:doSolve()D`** - This method contains the logic for the actual solving process and could be where the evaluations are being counted and checked against the maximum.\n5. **`BaseSecantSolver:doSolve()D`** - Since `RegulaFalsiSolver` is a subclass of `BaseSecantSolver`, this method may also be relevant as it could be involved in the evaluation process.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 10, 12, 14, 18]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to determine why the maximum evaluation count is being exceeded, leading to the failure of the test."
