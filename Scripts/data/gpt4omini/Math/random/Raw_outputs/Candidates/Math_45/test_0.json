"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath679` is failing because it expects an exception `NumberIsTooLargeException` to be thrown when creating an instance of `OpenMapRealMatrix` with parameters `(3, Integer.MAX_VALUE)`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs during the instantiation of `OpenMapRealMatrix`, which suggests that the constructor of this class is likely where the fault lies.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include the constructor of `OpenMapRealMatrix`, as well as several other methods that are invoked during its execution. The following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **OpenMapRealMatrix:<init>(II)** - This is the constructor that is directly invoked in the test. It initializes the matrix and may contain logic that leads to the exception being thrown.\n2. **OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:<init>(ID)** - This constructor is called within the `OpenMapRealMatrix` constructor. It initializes an internal data structure and may also contribute to the fault.\n3. **AbstractRealMatrix:<init>(II)** - This constructor is a superclass constructor that is called in the `OpenMapRealMatrix` constructor. It may contain validation logic that could lead to the exception.\n4. **OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:computeCapacity(I)** - This method is called within the `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap` constructor. If the expected size is not handled correctly, it could lead to issues.\n5. **OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:<init>(D)** - This constructor is also called within the `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap` class and may be relevant to the initialization process.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
