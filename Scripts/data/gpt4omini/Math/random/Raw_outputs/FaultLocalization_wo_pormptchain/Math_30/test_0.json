"Based on the provided test body and the stack trace, the following methods are ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'mannWhitneyUTest' is responsible for calculating the Mann-Whitney U statistic and returning the asymptotic p-value. Since the test fails when asserting that the result is greater than 0.1, this method is highly suspicious as it directly influences the output of the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'mannWhitneyU' calculates the U statistic based on the ranks of the combined samples. If there is an issue with how ranks are calculated or summed, it could lead to an incorrect U statistic, which would affect the test result.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'ensureDataConformance' method checks the validity of the input arrays.
