"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'parse' method in ProperFractionFormat is responsible for parsing the input string and handling the whole, numerator, and denominator formats. Since the test is failing due to an invalid minus in an improper fraction, this method is likely where the parsing logic is mishandling the input.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'parse' method in FractionFormat is called by the ProperFractionFormat's parse method.
