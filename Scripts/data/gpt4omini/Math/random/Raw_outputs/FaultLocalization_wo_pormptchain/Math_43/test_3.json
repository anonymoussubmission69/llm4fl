"Based on the provided test body and the stack trace, the test `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` is failing because it expected a specific value but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the geometric mean.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getResult() in GeometricMean returns Double.NaN if the sumOfLogs.getN() is not greater than 0. This suggests that if no values have been added to the SumOfLogs, the geometric mean will be NaN, which is likely the cause of the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The setGeoMeanImpl method sets the geoMeanImpl to a new instance of GeometricMean. If this method is not called correctly or if the implementation of GeometricMean is faulty, it could lead to NaN results.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The evaluate method in GeometricMean is responsible for calculating the geometric mean. If there is an issue in this method, it could lead to incorrect results, including NaN.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The evaluate method in SumOfLogs is responsible for summing the logarithms of the values. If this method does not handle the input correctly, it could lead to NaN results in the geometric mean calculation.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the calculation of the geometric mean and the potential for returning NaN values."
