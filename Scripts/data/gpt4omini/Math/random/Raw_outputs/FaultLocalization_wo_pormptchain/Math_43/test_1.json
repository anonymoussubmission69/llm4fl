"Based on the information gathered from the test body and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getResult() in GeometricMean returns Double.NaN if the number of logs (sumOfLogs.getN()) is not greater than 0. This could lead to the test failing if the geometric mean is expected to be a valid number but is instead NaN.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The increment method in SumOfLogs adds the logarithm of the value to the total. If the value is less than or equal to zero, this could result in NaN being added, which would affect the geometric mean calculation.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The addValue method in SummaryStatistics increments various statistics, including the geometric mean. If any of the values added are invalid (like NaN), it could lead to incorrect results in the geometric mean.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The evaluate method in SumOfLogs calculates the sum of logs for a given array of values. If any of the values are non-positive, it could lead to NaN results, affecting the overall calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
