"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'Variance:evaluate([DDII)D' is responsible for calculating the variance.
