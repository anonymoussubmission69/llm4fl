"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method FastMath.cosh(double x) is likely to be the source of the issue since the test is comparing the result of FastMath.cosh(x) with Math.cosh(x) for large negative values. The implementation of cosh may not handle extreme values correctly, leading to an Infinity result.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method FastMath.exp(double x) is called within the implementation of FastMath.cosh. If the exponentiation does not handle large negative inputs properly, it could contribute to the Infinity result observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method FastMath.ulp(double x) is used to calculate the unit in the last place, which could be relevant in the context of precision errors when dealing with large values. If it does not handle edge cases correctly, it might affect the results.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method FastMath.abs(double x) is a basic utility that is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure, but it is still involved in the calculations. If there are any unexpected behaviors with negative values, it could indirectly contribute to the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
