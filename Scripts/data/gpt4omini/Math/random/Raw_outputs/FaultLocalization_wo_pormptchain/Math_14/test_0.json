"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method createBlocksLayout is responsible for creating a layout for blocks in a matrix. Given that the test failed due to an OutOfMemoryError, this method could be allocating a large amount of memory for the matrix blocks, especially if the dimensions are large.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The createRealMatrix method is also related to matrix creation and could be contributing to excessive memory usage. It is invoked when creating a new matrix, which could lead to memory issues if the dimensions are large.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The fit method in CurveFitter is responsible for fitting a model to the data. If the data set is large, it could lead to high memory consumption during the fitting process, potentially causing an OutOfMemoryError.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The addObservedPoint method in CurveFitter adds points to the observations list. If this method is called excessively (e.g., 40000 times in the test), it could lead to high memory usage, especially if the points are not being managed properly.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
