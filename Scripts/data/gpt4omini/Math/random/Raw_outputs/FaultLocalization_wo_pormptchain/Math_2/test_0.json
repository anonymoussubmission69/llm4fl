"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of HypergeometricDistribution checks for invalid parameters (populationSize, numberOfSuccesses, sampleSize). If any of these are invalid, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the sample method, which is directly related to the failing test.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The sample method in AbstractIntegerDistribution calls inverseCumulativeProbability, which is crucial for generating samples. If the parameters are not set correctly, it could lead to invalid samples being generated, as seen in the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The inverseCumulativeProbability method has checks for the probability value and calculates bounds. If the bounds are incorrect due to invalid parameters, it could lead to returning an invalid sample, causing the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getNumericalMean method calculates the mean based on the parameters. If the parameters are invalid, it could lead to incorrect mean calculations, affecting the sampling process.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The calculateNumericalVariance method relies on the same parameters as the mean. If these parameters are invalid, it could lead to incorrect variance calculations, which could also affect the sampling.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the likelihood that each method's behavior could directly contribute to the failure observed in the test."
