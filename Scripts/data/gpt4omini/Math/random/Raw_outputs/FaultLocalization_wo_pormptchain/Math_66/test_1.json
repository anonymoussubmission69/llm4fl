"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getOptimaValues() throws an IllegalStateException if no optimum has been computed yet.

If the number of evaluations is not within the expected range (150 to 250), it could indicate that the optimization process did not perform as expected, which could lead to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The optimize() method is responsible for performing the optimization.
