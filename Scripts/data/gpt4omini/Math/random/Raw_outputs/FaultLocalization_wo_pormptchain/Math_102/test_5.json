"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed) calculates the chi-square statistic. The test failure indicates that the expected value does not match the actual computed value, suggesting a potential issue in this method's logic or calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed) is responsible for performing the chi-square test. Since the test is failing on the chi-square statistic, this method may also be involved in the incorrect computation of the test statistic.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom) sets the degrees of freedom for the distribution. If the degrees of freedom are incorrectly set, it could lead to incorrect statistical results, contributing to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method cumulativeProbability(double x) in GammaDistributionImpl is used to calculate cumulative probabilities. If the underlying distribution calculations are incorrect, it could affect the results of the chi-square test.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
