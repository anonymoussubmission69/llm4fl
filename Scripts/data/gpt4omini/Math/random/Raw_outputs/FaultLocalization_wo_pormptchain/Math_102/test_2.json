"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquareTest' is directly involved in calculating the chi-square test statistic, which is the source of the failure in the test. The expected value and the observed values are passed to this method, and it is responsible for returning the test statistic that is being asserted in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquare' computes the chi-square value based on the expected and observed arrays. Since the test is failing due to an incorrect test statistic, this method is likely involved in the calculation that leads to the discrepancy.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'setDistribution' sets the distribution used in the chi-square test. If the distribution is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect calculations in the chi-square test methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of 'ChiSquareTestImpl' initializes the object. If there is an issue with the initialization or the distribution being set, it could affect the subsequent calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
