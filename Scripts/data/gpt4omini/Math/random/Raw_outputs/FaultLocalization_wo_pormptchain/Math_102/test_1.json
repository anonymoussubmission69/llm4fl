"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquareTest' is responsible for calculating the chi-square test statistic. Since the test is failing due to an incorrect chi-square test statistic, this method is highly suspicious as it directly impacts the output being tested.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquare' calls 'chiSquareTest' and is responsible for computing the chi-square value based on expected and observed values. Any issues in this method could propagate to the final result, making it very suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquare' in 'TestUtils' is called in the test and is responsible for returning the chi-square value. If there are any issues in the logic of this method, it could lead to incorrect results, making it suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'setDistribution' sets the distribution used in the chi-square test. If the distribution is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect calculations in the chi-square test, making it a potential source of error.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
