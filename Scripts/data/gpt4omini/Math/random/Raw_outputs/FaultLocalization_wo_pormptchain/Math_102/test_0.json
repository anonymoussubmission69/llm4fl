"Based on the provided test failure information and the methods covered by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquareTest' is directly involved in performing the chi-square test, which is the focus of the failing test. The discrepancy in the expected and actual test statistic suggests that this method may not be calculating the test statistic correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquare' is responsible for calculating the chi-square value based on expected and observed values. Since the test is failing due to an incorrect statistic, this method is likely contributing to the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'cumulativeProbability' in 'ChiSquaredDistributionImpl' is called during the chi-square test calculation. If this method does not return the correct cumulative probability, it could lead to an incorrect test statistic.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'setDistribution' sets the distribution used in the chi-square test. If the distribution is not set correctly, it could affect the calculations in the chi-square test methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
