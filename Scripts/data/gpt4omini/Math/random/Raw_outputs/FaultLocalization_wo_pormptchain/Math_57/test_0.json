"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getNearestCluster calculates the distance from a point to the cluster centers.

This method is directly involved in determining the cluster center, which is the focus of the failing test.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The distanceFrom method in EuclideanIntegerPoint uses MathUtils.distance to calculate the distance between two points. If this method has a bug, it would affect the distance calculations used in getNearestCluster, leading to incorrect clustering results.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The MathUtils.distance method computes the Euclidean distance between two integer arrays.
