"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'cumulativeProbability' in 'NormalDistributionImpl' is directly involved in the test that is failing.

It is responsible for calculating the error function, which is critical for the cumulative probability calculations. If it fails to handle extreme values correctly, it could lead to the observed convergence exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'evaluate' method in 'ContinuedFraction' is involved in the computation of the error function. If this method does not handle certain inputs correctly, it could lead to the divergence to NaN that is causing the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'regularizedGammaP' method in the 'Gamma' class is also part of the calculations that could lead to the convergence exception.
