"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of the Fraction class is responsible for handling the conversion of a double value to a fraction. It checks for overflow conditions, which is directly related to the test case that is failing due to an expected exception not being thrown. This method is highly suspicious as it deals with potential integer overflow.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The FastMath.floor method is used within the Fraction constructor to convert a double to a long. If the input value is too large, it could lead to overflow. Since the test is checking for integer overflow, this method is also suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The FractionConversionException constructor is invoked when an overflow occurs. While it is not directly responsible for the failure, it is part of the flow that handles the exception. If the exception is not thrown as expected, this method could be indirectly related to the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is another constructor for the Fraction class that calls the primary constructor. It is less suspicious than the primary constructor but still relevant as it is part of the instantiation process.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
