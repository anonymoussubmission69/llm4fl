"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method is part of the RectangularCholeskyDecomposition class, which is directly involved in the computation of the root matrix. The test failure indicates that the reconstructed matrix does not match the original, suggesting a potential issue in the decomposition logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method returns the root matrix from the RectangularCholeskyDecomposition. If the root matrix is incorrect, it would lead to the failure observed in the test. It is crucial to verify if the root matrix is being computed correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if two matrices are compatible for subtraction. If there is an issue with the dimensions or compatibility checks, it could lead to incorrect results in the subtraction operation, which is part of the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method performs the subtraction operation between two matrices. If there is a bug in how entries are subtracted, it could directly cause the assertion failure in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method calculates the norm of a matrix. If the norm calculation is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect results in the assertion, although it is less likely to be the direct cause compared to the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
