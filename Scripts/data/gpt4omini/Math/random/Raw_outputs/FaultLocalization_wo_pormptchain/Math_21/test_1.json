"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method is part of the RectangularCholeskyDecomposition class, which is directly involved in the decomposition process. The test fails when checking the norm of the difference between the original matrix and the rebuilt matrix, indicating a potential issue in the decomposition logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method retrieves the root matrix from the RectangularCholeskyDecomposition. If the root matrix is not computed correctly, it would lead to incorrect results in the subsequent operations, which could cause the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The multiply method is responsible for matrix multiplication. If there is an issue in how matrices are multiplied, it could lead to incorrect results when reconstructing the original matrix from the root matrix.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if two matrices are compatible for subtraction. If the dimensions are not compatible, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the subtraction operation, which is critical for the test's assertions.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
