"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of ElitisticListPopulation takes an elitism rate as a parameter. The test case is expecting an OutOfRangeException when a negative elitism rate (-0.25) is provided. This indicates that the method should validate the elitism rate and throw an exception for invalid values, which it seems to be failing to do.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of ListPopulation checks if the population limit is less than or equal to zero. While this method is not directly related to the test case, it is still part of the population initialization process. If the population limit were to be negative, it could lead to unexpected behavior, but it is less directly related to the failing test than the ElitisticListPopulation constructor.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
