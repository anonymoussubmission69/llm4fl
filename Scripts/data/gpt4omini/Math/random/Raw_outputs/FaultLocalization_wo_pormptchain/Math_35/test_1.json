"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The ElitisticListPopulation constructor calls the superclass constructor ListPopulation. The test is expecting an OutOfRangeException due to the elitism rate being set to 1.25, which is outside the valid range. This suggests that the constructor may not be properly validating the elitism rate, making it highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The ListPopulation constructor checks if the size of chromosomes exceeds the population limit but does not seem to validate the elitism rate. Since the test fails due to an exception related to the elitism rate, this method is also suspicious but less so than the ElitisticListPopulation constructor.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
