"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'validateParameters' checks if the parameters are valid for the Gaussian function. It specifically checks if the third parameter (sigma) is less than or equal to zero, which is directly related to the exception thrown in the test. This method is crucial for ensuring that the parameters passed to the Gaussian function are valid, and if they are not, it throws a NotStrictlyPositiveException.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'gradient' in the Gaussian's Parametric class calls 'validateParameters' before performing calculations.

This method is directly involved in the computation that leads to the exception being thrown.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'value' in the Gaussian class computes the Gaussian function value based on the parameters.
