"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testChiSquare` is failing because the expected chi-square test statistic does not match the actual computed value. The expected value is `9.023307936427388`, but the computed value is `16.413107036160778`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the chi-square statistic or the parameters being passed to it.\n\n2. The methods involved in the chi-square calculation are `chiSquare`, `chiSquareTest`, and potentially others that contribute to the calculation of the cumulative probability and regularized gamma function.\n\n3. The method `chiSquare` (method_id 25) is responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic based on the expected and observed values. If there is an issue in this method, it could directly affect the test's outcome.\n\n4. The method `chiSquareTest` (method_id 3) is responsible for calculating the p-value based on the chi-square statistic. If the statistic is incorrect, the p-value will also be incorrect.\n\n5. The method `chiSquare` (method_id 0) is a wrapper that calls `chiSquareTest.chiSquare`, which means it is indirectly involved in the calculation.\n\n6. The methods `cumulativeProbability` (method_id 1) and `regularizedGammaP` (method_id 6) are more distant from the direct calculation of the chi-square statistic and are less likely to be the source of the fault.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The chiSquare method directly calculates the chi-square statistic using the expected and observed values.
