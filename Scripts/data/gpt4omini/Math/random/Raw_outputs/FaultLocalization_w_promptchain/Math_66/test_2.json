"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected value of `-0.2719561270319131` does not match the actual result of `-0.2719561299044896`. This suggests that there is a problem with the optimization process, likely in how the function is evaluated or how the optimization algorithm is implemented.\n\n2. The methods provided are related to the optimization process, specifically in computing optima and evaluating the objective function. The methods `getOptimaValues`, `optimize`, and `computeObjectiveValue` are all involved in this process.\n\n3. The method `getOptimaValues` throws an `IllegalStateException` if no optimum has been computed yet, which could be relevant if the optimizer is not correctly computing optima.\n\n4. The method `optimize` is responsible for finding the optimum value, and any issues in its logic could directly affect the results.\n\n5. The method `computeObjectiveValue` is responsible for evaluating the function at a given point, and if it does not handle evaluations correctly, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\nBased on this analysis, the methods can be ranked as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'optimize' method is crucial for finding the optimum value. If there are any logical errors in how it processes the function or manages iterations, it could lead to incorrect results, which is evident from the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'computeObjectiveValue' method evaluates the function at a given point. If it does not handle evaluations correctly or exceeds the maximum evaluations, it could lead to incorrect results, contributing to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getOptimaValues' method throws an exception if no optimum has been computed. While it is important, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure compared to the optimization and evaluation methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method appears to be part of the optimization process but is less directly related to the failure since it seems to handle multiple starts and iterations. It is less suspicious than the others.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
