"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` indicating that an invalid minus sign was encountered in the improper fraction parsing. The stack trace suggests that the failure occurs when trying to parse a string representation of a fraction.\n\nHere\u2019s the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The parse method attempts to parse the numerator from the source string. If it fails to parse a valid number, it sets the error index and returns null. This method is directly involved in parsing the input string and is likely where the invalid minus sign issue originates.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method extends the parsing functionality and handles both whole numbers and fractions. It also attempts to parse the denominator after parsing the numerator. If the denominator parsing fails, it could lead to an invalid fraction being created, which is relevant to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor for the Fraction class checks for a zero denominator and reduces the fraction. If the denominator is incorrectly set due to parsing issues, it could lead to an invalid state. This method is suspicious as it could be affected by the parsing methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method parses the next character from the source string while ignoring whitespace. If it incorrectly identifies a character due to parsing logic, it could contribute to the failure. However, it is less directly related to the fraction parsing than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for ignoring whitespace in the input string. While it is important for parsing, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure compared to the methods that handle number parsing.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method simply returns the numerator format. It is not directly involved in parsing logic and is less suspicious in the context of the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Similar to method 3, this method returns the denominator format. It does not perform any parsing or logic that could lead to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method returns the whole format. It is the least suspicious as it does not interact with the parsing logic that is likely causing the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
