"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `testBoundaryRangeTooLarge` is failing because it expected a `NumberIsTooLargeException` but received a `MathIllegalStateException`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the boundaries are being handled in the optimization process.\n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **Method ID 54**: \n   - **Body**: The method seems to handle a value based on some boundaries and a repair mode. However, the body is incomplete and does not provide enough context on how it processes the input.\n   - **Suspicion**: The incomplete handling of boundaries and the potential for a `MathIllegalStateException` suggests that this method could be improperly managing the state of the optimization process, especially if it is supposed to handle boundary conditions.\n\n2. **Method ID 8**: \n   - **Body**: This method checks parameters, including lower and upper bounds. It has logic to determine if bounds are finite and sets up boundaries based on that. However, the logic appears to be incomplete and may not correctly handle cases where bounds are infinite.\n   - **Suspicion**: Since the test is related to boundary conditions, this method is highly suspicious as it directly deals with the bounds that are likely causing the exception.\n\n3. **Method ID 27**: \n   - **Body**: This method calls `optimizeInternal`, which is likely where the optimization logic resides. However, it does not directly handle any boundary conditions itself.\n   - **Suspicion**: While it is part of the optimization process, it does not directly manage the boundaries, making it less suspicious compared to the other two methods.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks and sets the boundaries for the optimization process.
