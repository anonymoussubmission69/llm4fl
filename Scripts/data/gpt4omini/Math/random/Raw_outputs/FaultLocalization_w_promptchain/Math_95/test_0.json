"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'inverseCumulativeProbability' is directly involved in the test case that fails. The stack trace indicates that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown when this method is called with invalid parameters. The method checks for specific values of 'p' but does not handle cases where 'p' is outside the expected range, which could lead to the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'bracket' method is called within the 'inverseCumulativeProbability' method. If the parameters passed to 'bracket' are invalid, it could lead to the exception seen in the stack trace. The method's implementation suggests it is responsible for setting up bounds, which could be related to the invalid parameters causing the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor for 'FDistributionImpl' initializes the degrees of freedom. If the degrees of freedom are set incorrectly, it could lead to invalid behavior in the 'inverseCumulativeProbability' method. However, it is less directly related to the exception than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getInitialDomain' method calculates a value based on the denominator degrees of freedom. If the degrees of freedom are not set correctly, this could lead to issues in methods that rely on this value. However, it is less directly related to the exception than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom' method simply returns a value. While it is important for the calculations, it does not directly contribute to the exception being thrown. It is the least suspicious as it does not involve any logic that could lead to an invalid state.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
