"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` is designed to check the parsing of a string that represents a fraction. The test expects a `ParseException` to be thrown when an invalid minus sign is encountered in the input string. The stack trace indicates that the test fails because the expected exception is not thrown, leading to an assertion failure.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods to determine their suspiciousness:\n\n1. **Method 11 (parse(String source, ParsePosition pos))**: This method is responsible for parsing the input string into a `Fraction`. It checks for the numerator and handles errors. Since the test is failing due to improper parsing, this method is highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Method 17 (parse(String source, ParsePosition pos))**: This method extends the parsing functionality and includes additional checks for whole numbers and denominators. Given that it is also involved in parsing, it is suspicious as well, especially since it handles multiple components of a fraction.\n\n3. **Method 10 (Fraction(int num, int den))**: This constructor initializes a `Fraction` object. If the denominator is zero, it could lead to issues. Although it is not directly related to parsing, it could be indirectly involved if the parsing logic leads to a zero denominator.\n\n4. **Method 12 (parseNextCharacter(String source, ParsePosition pos))**: This method is responsible for parsing the next character in the string. If it fails to correctly identify characters, it could lead to parsing errors. It is somewhat suspicious but less so than the parsing methods.\n\n5. **Method 19 (parseAndIgnoreWhitespace)**: This method is used to ignore whitespace in the input string. While it is necessary for parsing, it is less likely to be the source of the fault compared to the actual parsing methods.\n\n6. **Method 3 (getNumeratorFormat())**: This method returns the format used for parsing the numerator. It is less suspicious since it does not perform any parsing itself.\n\n7. **Method 6 (getDenominatorFormat())**: Similar to method 3, this method returns the format for the denominator. It is not directly involved in parsing logic.\n\n8. **Method 1 (getWholeFormat())**: This method returns the format for whole numbers. It is the least suspicious as it does not contribute to the parsing logic directly.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for parsing the input string into a Fraction and handles errors related to numerator parsing.
