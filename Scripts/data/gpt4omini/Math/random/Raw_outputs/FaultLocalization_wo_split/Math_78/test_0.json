"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method evaluates a step using a solver and checks for conditions that could lead to an exception if the function values at the endpoints do not have different signs. The stack trace indicates that this method is involved in the failure due to the sign of the function values at the endpoints being the same, which directly relates to the error encountered.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for solving a univariate function and includes checks for the signs of the function values at the interval endpoints. If the signs are the same, it throws an exception. This method is likely to be involved in the failure as it directly handles the function values that are causing the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is similar to method 24, as it also evaluates a step and uses a solver. However, it is less suspicious than method 24 because it does not directly relate to the error in the stack trace, but it still plays a role in the evaluation process.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method verifies the interval for the solver but does not directly relate to the error in the stack trace. It is more of a utility method and does not handle the function values or the solving process directly, making it the least suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
