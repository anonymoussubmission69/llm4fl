"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` related to invalid endpoint parameters in the `bracket` method. This indicates that the parameters being passed to the method are not valid, which could be due to incorrect values being set or calculated in the methods leading up to this call.\n\n2. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method is directly involved in the stack trace, and it is responsible for handling the cumulative probability values. If the input `p` is not handled correctly, it could lead to invalid parameters being passed to the `bracket` method.\n\n3. The `FDistributionImpl` constructor initializes the degrees of freedom, which are critical for the calculations in the distribution methods. If these values are not set correctly, it could lead to invalid states in the object.\n\n4. The `getInitialDomain` method calculates a value based on the denominator degrees of freedom, which could also contribute to the invalid parameters if the degrees of freedom are not set correctly.\n\n5. The `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` method simply returns the value of `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom`, which is a straightforward getter and is less likely to be the source of the problem.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The bracket method is directly involved in the stack trace and is responsible for validating the parameters.
