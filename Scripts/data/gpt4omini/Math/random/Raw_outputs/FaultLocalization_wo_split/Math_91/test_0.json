"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testCompareTo` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected value is -1, but the actual value returned is 0. This indicates that the `compareTo` method is not correctly comparing the two `Fraction` objects.\n\n### Method Analysis:\n1. **Method ID 2: `compareTo(Fraction object)`**\n   - This method compares the double values of the current `Fraction` object and the passed `Fraction` object. The logic seems straightforward, but if the `doubleValue()` method does not return the expected results, it could lead to incorrect comparisons.\n   - **Suspiciousness**: High, as it directly relates to the failing test.\n\n2. **Method ID 0: `doubleValue()`**\n   - This method converts the fraction to a double by dividing the numerator by the denominator. If the denominator is zero or if there are issues with the values of numerator and denominator, this could lead to incorrect results.\n   - **Suspiciousness**: Medium, as it is indirectly related to the failure through the `compareTo` method.\n\n3. **Method ID 3: `Fraction(int num, int den)`**\n   - This constructor initializes a `Fraction` object. The logic for handling the denominator being zero is incomplete in the provided snippet, which could lead to invalid `Fraction` objects being created.\n   - **Suspiciousness**: Medium, as it could lead to invalid fractions being compared.\n\n4. **Method ID 1: `gcd(int p, int q)`**\n   - This method calculates the greatest common divisor. While it is important for reducing fractions, it does not directly relate to the comparison logic or the failure in the test.\n   - **Suspiciousness**: Low, as it does not directly impact the failing test.\n\n### Ranking:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The compareTo method directly compares two Fraction objects.
