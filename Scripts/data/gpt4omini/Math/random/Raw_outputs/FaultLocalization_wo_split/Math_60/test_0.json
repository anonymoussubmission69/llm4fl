"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'erf' method calls 'Gamma.regularizedGammaP', which is critical for calculating the cumulative probability. If 'Gamma.regularizedGammaP' fails or returns incorrect values, it can lead to NaN results in the cumulative probability calculations, as seen in the stack trace.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'regularizedGammaP' method is directly involved in the computation of the gamma function, which is used in the 'erf' method. If this method encounters invalid inputs or fails to converge, it can propagate errors up to the 'cumulativeProbability' method, leading to the observed NaN results.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'cumulativeProbability' method is the entry point for the test and relies on the 'erf' method. If 'erf' returns NaN due to issues in its dependencies, this method will also fail. However, it is more of a symptom of the underlying issues in 'erf' and 'regularizedGammaP'.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'evaluate' method is part of the continued fraction evaluation process. If it encounters infinite values or fails to converge, it can lead to issues in the calculations that affect the 'Gamma' functions. However, it is less directly related to the immediate failure observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'logGamma' method is used in the computation of the gamma function but is not directly implicated in the failure observed in the test. It may contribute to the overall calculations but is less likely to be the source of the immediate issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'ConvergenceException' class is used for error handling and does not contain any logic that could lead to the failure observed in the test.
