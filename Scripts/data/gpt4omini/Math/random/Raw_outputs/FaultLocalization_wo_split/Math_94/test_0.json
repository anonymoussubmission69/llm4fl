However, the implementation has a logical flaw where it does not correctly handle the case when either u or v is zero. Instead of returning the sum of their absolute values, it should return the non-zero value or zero if both are zero. This could lead to incorrect results, as indicated by the test failure where the expected value was 98304 but the actual result was 3440640.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
