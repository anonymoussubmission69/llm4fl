"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testMath785` is failing due to an inaccurate result from the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `FDistribution` class. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when trying to assert that the result of `inverseCumulativeProbability(prob)` is less than 1.0, but it fails, leading to an `AssertionFailedError`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods to determine their suspiciousness:\n\n1. **Method 19: `inverseCumulativeProbability`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is directly involved in the failing test. It calculates the inverse cumulative probability, which is critical for the test's assertion. If this method produces an incorrect result, it will directly cause the test to fail.\n   - **Rank**: 1\n\n2. **Method 26: `cumulativeProbability`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is called within `inverseCumulativeProbability`. If `cumulativeProbability` returns incorrect values, it will affect the calculations in `inverseCumulativeProbability`, leading to potential inaccuracies in the test.\n   - **Rank**: 2\n\n3. **Method 30: `getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method retrieves a value that is likely used in the calculations of `cumulativeProbability` and `inverseCumulativeProbability`. If the degrees of freedom are set incorrectly, it could lead to incorrect probability calculations.\n   - **Rank**: 3\n\n4. **Method 21: `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom`**\n   - **Reasoning**: Similar to `getNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom`, this method retrieves a value that is essential for the calculations in the probability methods. An incorrect value here could also lead to inaccuracies.\n   - **Rank**: 4\n\n5. **Method 23: `regularizedBeta`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is used in the calculation of the cumulative probability. If it does not handle its inputs correctly, it could propagate errors back to the `cumulativeProbability` and `inverseCumulativeProbability` methods.\n   - **Rank**: 5\n\n6. **Method 20: `log`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is a utility function for logarithmic calculations. While it may be used in the calculations, it is less directly related to the failure of the test compared to the methods above.\n   - **Rank**: 6\n\n7. **Method 49: `exp`**\n   - **Reasoning**: Similar to `log`, this method is a utility for exponential calculations. It is the least suspicious as it does not directly relate to the failing test case.\n   - **Rank**: 7\n\nHere is the JSON output with the rankings:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is directly involved in the failing test.
