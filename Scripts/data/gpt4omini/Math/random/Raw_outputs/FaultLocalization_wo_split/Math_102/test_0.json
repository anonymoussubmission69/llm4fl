"Based on the analysis of the test failure and the method bodies, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method chiSquare computes the chi-square statistic. The test failure indicates a significant discrepancy between the expected and observed values, which suggests that this method may not be correctly calculating the statistic, especially since it checks for conditions that could lead to incorrect calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The chiSquareTest method uses the chi-square statistic to compute a probability. If the chi-square statistic is incorrect (as indicated by the previous method), this method will also yield incorrect results, leading to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method calculates cumulative probability based on a gamma distribution. If the inputs to this method are incorrect due to previous calculations, it could lead to the observed test failure. However, it is less directly related than the first two methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method also calculates cumulative probability but relies on another method to do so. Its role is more of a helper function, and while it could contribute to the failure, it is less likely to be the primary source of the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method computes a regularized gamma function, which is a mathematical function used in probability calculations. While it could indirectly affect the results, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method computes the logarithm of the gamma function.
