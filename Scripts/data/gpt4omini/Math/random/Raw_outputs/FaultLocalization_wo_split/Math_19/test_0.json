"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `testBoundaryRangeTooLarge` is failing because it expected a `NumberIsTooLargeException` but received a `MathIllegalStateException`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the boundaries are being handled in the optimization process.\n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **Method ID 54**: \n   - **Body**: The method checks if boundaries are not null and if it is in repair mode. It attempts to repair the point if necessary.\n   - **Suspicion**: This method is directly involved in handling the boundaries and could be responsible for the unexpected exception if the boundaries are not set correctly or if the repair logic is flawed.\n\n2. **Method ID 8**: \n   - **Body**: This method checks the parameters, specifically the lower and upper bounds. It contains logic to determine if the bounds are finite and sets the boundaries accordingly.\n   - **Suspicion**: This method is crucial for setting the boundaries that are used in the optimization process. If it incorrectly identifies the bounds as finite or infinite, it could lead to the wrong exception being thrown.\n\n3. **Method ID 27**: \n   - **Body**: This method calls `optimizeInternal` with the provided parameters.\n   - **Suspicion**: While this method is part of the optimization process, it is more of a wrapper and does not contain logic that directly manipulates the boundaries. Therefore, it is less suspicious compared to the other two methods.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 54,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for handling the boundaries and may be involved in the repair process.
