The test case is failing due to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, which suggests that the method is trying to access an index that does not exist in one of the input arrays. The method checks if the lengths of the two arrays are equal, but it does not handle the case where either array is empty or has a length of 1, which could lead to accessing an index that is out of bounds. This makes it the most suspicious method.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
