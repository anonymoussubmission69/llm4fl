The comment in the stack trace suggests that there might be an issue with the logic in this method.\n\n2. **`BOBYQAOptimizer.bobyqb`** (method_id: 13) - This method is called within the `prelim` method and is part of the optimization process. Any issues in the optimization logic could propagate from here.\n\n3. **`BaseAbstractMultivariateOptimizer.computeObjectiveValue`** (method_id: 0) - This method is responsible for computing the objective value, which is critical in optimization algorithms. If there is an error in how the objective value is computed, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **`BOBYQAOptimizer.setup`** (method_id: 1) - This method sets up the optimizer and initializes various parameters. If the setup is incorrect, it could lead to failures in the optimization process.\n\n5. **`BOBYQAOptimizer.doOptimize`** (method_id: 3) - This method orchestrates the optimization process. Any issues in the overall flow of the optimization could be traced back to this method.\n\n6. **`BaseAbstractMultivariateOptimizer.optimize`** (method_id: 18) - This method is the entry point for the optimization process and could be responsible for passing incorrect parameters or states to the optimizer.\n\n7. **`BOBYQAOptimizer.bobyqa`** (method_id: 32) - This method is also part of the optimization process and could be involved in the logic that leads to the exception.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 13, 18, 24]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
