The test expected a `ConvergenceException` instead.\n\nThe relevant part of the stack trace shows that the exception was thrown from the `incrementEvaluationCount` method in the `BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver` class, which is called during the `computeObjectiveValue` method. The `solve` method in the `BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver` is also involved, as it sets up the evaluation process.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:incrementEvaluationCount()`** - This method is directly responsible for incrementing the evaluation count and throwing the `TooManyEvaluationsException`.\n2. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:computeObjectiveValue(double)`** - This method calls `incrementEvaluationCount()` and is involved in the evaluation process.\n3. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:solve(int, UnivariateRealFunction, double, double)`** - This method is the entry point for solving the function and sets up the evaluation process.\n4. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:setup(int, UnivariateRealFunction, double, double, double)`** - This method initializes the solver and sets the maximum evaluation count.\n5. **`BaseSecantSolver:doSolve()`** - This method is part of the solving process and may be involved in how evaluations are handled.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [15, 24, 11, 13, 31]\n}\n```"
