    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideVarianceWithMathClass` is failing due to an assertion that expected a variance value of `1.25` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of variance within the `SummaryStatistics` or `Variance` classes.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Variance:evaluate** - This method is responsible for calculating the variance. If it returns `NaN`, it could be due to improper handling of the input values or an issue in the logic.\n2. **SummaryStatistics:addValue** - This method adds values to the statistics and calls other methods to update various statistics, including variance. If the input values are not being processed correctly, it could lead to incorrect variance calculations.\n3. **SummaryStatistics:setVarianceImpl** - This method sets the variance implementation. If the wrong implementation is set or if the implementation has issues, it could affect the variance calculation.\n4. **Variance:getResult** - This method retrieves the result of the variance calculation. If the internal state is not correctly maintained, it could return `NaN`.\n5. **Mean:evaluate** - This method calculates the mean, which is often used in variance calculations. If the mean is calculated incorrectly, it could propagate errors to the variance calculation.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 5, 6, 24, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
