    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion that expected a value of `false` but received `true`. This indicates that there is a logical error in the code being tested, specifically in the method `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()` of the `FDistribution` class, which is returning `true` when it should not.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `FastMath` and `FDistribution` classes, among others. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`** - This method is directly related to the test failure, as it is the method being tested.\n2. **`log(D[D)D`** - This method is a mathematical function that could be involved in calculations leading to the result being tested.\n3. **`floor(D)D`** - Similar to the log function, this method could also be involved in the calculations.\n4. **`log1p(D)D`** - This method is another mathematical function that may affect the outcome.\n5. **`density(D)D`** - This method is part of the `FDistribution` class and could be related to the support lower bound logic.\n\nGiven the context, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods identified for further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [9, 0, 1, 4, 21]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 9**: `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`\n- **Method ID 0**: `log(D[D)D`\n- **Method ID 1**: `floor(D)D`\n- **Method ID 4**: `log1p(D)D`\n- **Method ID 21**: `density(D)D`\n\nThese methods should be examined to understand their logic and how they might contribute to the failure of the test."
