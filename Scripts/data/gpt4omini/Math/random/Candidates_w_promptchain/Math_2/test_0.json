    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath1021` is failing due to an assertion error indicating that the sampled value is -50, which is outside the expected range of 0 to n (where n is 50). This suggests that there is an issue with the sampling method in the `HypergeometricDistribution` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several constructors and methods related to the `HypergeometricDistribution`, as well as methods from the `AbstractWell` and `RandomDataImpl` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **HypergeometricDistribution Constructor**: This method initializes the distribution and could be responsible for setting up incorrect parameters.\n2. **sample() Method**: This method is directly responsible for generating the sample value, which is where the failure occurs.\n3. **inverseCumulativeProbability() Method**: This method is used in the sampling process and could lead to incorrect sampling if it has issues.\n4. **getSupportLowerBound() Method**: This method determines the lower bound of the support for the distribution, which is critical for ensuring that the sampled value is within the expected range.\n5. **getSupportUpperBound() Method**: Similar to the lower bound, this method determines the upper limit of the support.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 14, 18, 8, 17]\n}\n```"
