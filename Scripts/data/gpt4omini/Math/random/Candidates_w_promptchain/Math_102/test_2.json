    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` is failing due to an assertion error related to the chi-square test statistic. The expected value is `114875.90421929007`, but the actual value returned is `3624883.3429077636`. This indicates a significant discrepancy, suggesting that there may be an issue in the calculation of the chi-square statistic.\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test include several that are directly related to the chi-square test and its calculations. Here are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquareTest([D[J)D` (method_id: 4)** - This method is responsible for performing the chi-square test and is likely where the discrepancy originates.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquare([D[J)D` (method_id: 23)** - This method appears to be involved in calculating the chi-square value based on expected and observed values.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl:isPositive([D)Z` (method_id: 12)** - This method checks if the expected values are positive, which is a prerequisite for the chi-square test.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl:isNonNegative([J)Z` (method_id: 13)** - This method checks if the observed values are non-negative, which is also a prerequisite for the chi-square test.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math.distribution.ChiSquaredDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D` (method_id: 18)** - This method is involved in calculating the cumulative probability for the chi-squared distribution, which may affect the test results.\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math.distribution.ChiSquaredDistributionImpl:setDegreesOfFreedom(D)V` (method_id: 5)** - This method sets the degrees of freedom for the chi-squared distribution, which is critical for accurate calculations.\n\nGiven the context of the failure and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 12, 13, 18, 5, 23]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the discrepancy in the chi-square test statistic calculation."
