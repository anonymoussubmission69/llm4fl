    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failure is related to a discrepancy between the expected and actual chi-square test statistic values. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `chiSquareTest` method of the `ChiSquareTestImpl` class, which suggests that the methods involved in calculating the chi-square statistic are likely to be the source of the issue.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to chi-square calculations, gamma distributions, and continued fractions. Here are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquareTest** - This method is directly involved in calculating the chi-square test statistic. Any issues in its logic could lead to incorrect results.\n2. **ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquare** - This method also contributes to the chi-square calculations and should be examined for correctness.\n3. **ChiSquaredDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability** - This method is used to compute the cumulative probability, which is essential for the chi-square test.\n4. **GammaDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability** - This method is involved in the gamma distribution calculations, which are part of the chi-square test.\n5. **Gamma:regularizedGammaP** - This method is used in the calculation of the regularized gamma function, which is critical for the chi-square test.\n6. **ContinuedFraction:evaluate** - This method is used in the evaluation of continued fractions, which may affect the results of the gamma functions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 24, 19, 2, 16, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be investigated to identify the root cause of the test failure."
