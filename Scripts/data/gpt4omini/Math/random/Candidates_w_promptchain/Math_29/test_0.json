This indicates that there might be an issue with how values are being computed or handled, particularly in operations that involve mathematical calculations.\n\nThe stack trace points to the following methods as potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector:ebeMultiply(Lorg/apache/commons/math3/linear/RealVector;)`** - This method is responsible for element-wise multiplication of vectors, which could lead to unexpected results if any of the entries are not handled correctly.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector:isDefaultValue(D)`** - This method checks if a value is considered a default value. If the logic here is flawed, it could lead to incorrect handling of values during operations.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:floor(D)`** - The `floor` function is used to round down to the nearest integer. If it encounters `NaN`, it could propagate through calculations.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:ceil(D)`** - Similar to `floor`, this method rounds up and could also be involved in producing unexpected results if `NaN` is encountered.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector:getEntry(I)`** - This method retrieves an entry from the vector. If the index is out of bounds or if the entry is not properly initialized, it could lead to incorrect values being returned.\n\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:get(I)`** - This method retrieves a value from a hash map. If the key does not exist or if there is an issue with the underlying data structure, it could return unexpected results.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [25, 14, 1, 21, 18, 19]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
