    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath905LargeNegative` is failing due to an assertion that expected a maximum error (`maxErr`) of `0.0`, but instead received `Infinity`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the calculations performed in the methods being tested, particularly those related to hyperbolic functions (`cosh` and `sinh`).\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `FastMath` class, which are directly involved in the calculations leading to the assertion failure. The methods that are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`FastMath.cosh(double x)`** - This method is directly involved in the calculation of the hyperbolic cosine, which is likely where the error originates.\n2. **`FastMath.sinh(double x)`** - Similar to `cosh`, this method is involved in the calculation of the hyperbolic sine and could also contribute to the error.\n3. **`FastMath.exp(double x)`** - The exponential function is often used in the calculations of hyperbolic functions, and if it returns an incorrect value, it could lead to `Infinity` results.\n4. **`FastMath.ulp(double x)`** - This method is used to calculate the unit in the last place, which could be relevant in determining the precision of the calculations.\n5. **`FastMath.max(double a, double b)`** - This method is used to determine the maximum value, and if it is not functioning correctly, it could affect the final result.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 19, 14, 9, 1]\n}\n``` \n\nIn this JSON:\n- `4` corresponds to `FastMath.cosh(double x)`\n- `19` corresponds to `FastMath.exp(double x)`\n- `14` corresponds to `FastMath.max(double a, double b)`\n- `9` corresponds to `FastMath.ulp(double x)`\n- `1` corresponds to `FastMath.abs(double x)`\n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
