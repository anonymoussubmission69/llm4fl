    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMean()` is designed to check the behavior of the `PoissonDistributionImpl` class when initialized with a negative mean. The expectation is that it should throw a `NotStrictlyPositiveException`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception is thrown in the constructor of `PoissonDistributionImpl`, specifically at line 94, where it checks if the mean is less than or equal to zero and throws an exception if it is.\n3. The constructor of `PoissonDistributionImpl` is called with a negative value (-1), which leads to the exception being thrown.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 1**: `PoissonDistributionImpl:<init>(DDI)V` - This is the constructor of `PoissonDistributionImpl` where the exception is thrown for a negative mean.\n- **Method ID 3**: `MathRuntimeException:createIllegalArgumentException(...)` - This method is responsible for creating the exception that is thrown when the mean is invalid.\n- **Method ID 7**: `PoissonDistributionImpl:<init>(D)V` - This is another constructor of `PoissonDistributionImpl` that calls the primary constructor with default values, which may also be relevant.\n\nThe other methods do not seem directly related to the fault since they are either utility methods or part of the distribution hierarchy that do not handle the mean validation directly.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 3, 7]\n}\n```"
