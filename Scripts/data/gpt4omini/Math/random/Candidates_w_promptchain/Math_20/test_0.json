It is crucial to check how it handles the bounds and the optimization logic.\n2. **CMAESOptimizer$FitnessFunction:value** - This method is responsible for calculating the fitness value, which is critical for the optimization process. Any issues here could lead to incorrect results.\n3. **CMAESOptimizer$FitnessFunction:repair** - This method is responsible for repairing the values to ensure they are within bounds. If it fails to do so, it could lead to out-of-bounds errors.\n4. **CMAESOptimizer:checkParameters** - This method checks the parameters before optimization. If it does not correctly validate the bounds, it could lead to invalid optimization attempts.\n5. **CMAESOptimizer:initializeCMA** - This method initializes the CMA-ES algorithm parameters. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to improper optimization behavior.\n6. **CMAESOptimizer:randn1** - This method generates random numbers for the optimization process. If the random generation is flawed, it could affect the optimization results.\n7. **CMAESOptimizer:updateCovariance** - This method updates the covariance matrix, which is essential for the CMA-ES algorithm. Any issues here could lead to incorrect optimization paths.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [27, 55, 85, 86, 120, 4, 25]\n}\n```"
