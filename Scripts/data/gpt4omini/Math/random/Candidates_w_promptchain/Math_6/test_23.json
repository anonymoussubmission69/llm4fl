Since the test is failing during the optimization, this method is critical to investigate.\n2. **SimplexOptimizer:checkParameters()** - This method checks the parameters before optimization. If the parameters are not set correctly, it could lead to failures in the optimization process.\n3. **BaseOptimizer:getEvaluations()** - This method retrieves the number of evaluations. The test checks if the evaluations are within a certain range, so any issues here could affect the test outcome.\n4. **NelderMeadSimplex:iterate()** - This method is part of the Nelder-Mead algorithm used in the optimization process. Any issues in the iteration logic could lead to incorrect results.\n5. **ObjectiveFunction:getObjectiveFunction()** - This method retrieves the objective function being optimized. If the function is not defined correctly, it could lead to incorrect optimization results.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they are part of the optimization process, and issues in one could propagate to others.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [30, 54, 3, 47, 58]\n}\n```"
