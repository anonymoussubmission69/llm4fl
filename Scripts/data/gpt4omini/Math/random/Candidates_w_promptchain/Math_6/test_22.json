The test `testMinimize2` is designed to test the `SimplexOptimizer` class, specifically its ability to minimize a function defined by `FourExtrema`.\n2. The test fails at an assertion, indicating that the expected values do not match the actual values returned by the optimizer.\n3. The stack trace points to the `assertTrue` method in the `Assert` class, which suggests that the failure is related to the evaluations or iterations of the optimizer.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **SimplexOptimizer**: This is the main class being tested. Any issues in its implementation could directly affect the test results.\n- **getEvaluations()**: This method returns the count of evaluations made by the optimizer. If this count is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect optimization results.\n- **getIterations()**: Similar to evaluations, the number of iterations could also affect the optimization process.\n- **doOptimize()**: This method is responsible for performing the optimization. Any logical errors here could lead to incorrect results.\n- **checkParameters()**: This method checks the parameters before optimization. If the parameters are not set correctly, it could lead to failures in the optimization process.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 3, 38, 31, 56]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
