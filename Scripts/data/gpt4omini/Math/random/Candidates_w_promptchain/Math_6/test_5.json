The test `testMaximize1` is designed to test the `SimplexOptimizer` class, specifically its optimization capabilities. The test fails at assertions that check the values returned by the optimizer against expected values from the `FourExtrema` class.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs during assertions related to the optimization results, which suggests that the issue may lie within the optimization logic or the parameters being passed to the optimizer.\n\n3. The covered methods include various components of the optimization process, including the `SimplexOptimizer`, `ObjectiveFunction`, and convergence checking mechanisms. \n\n4. The methods that are particularly relevant to the optimization process and may be suspicious include:\n   - `doOptimize()` in `SimplexOptimizer` (method_id: 30)\n   - `checkParameters()` in `SimplexOptimizer` (method_id: 54)\n   - `evaluate()` in `AbstractSimplex` (method_id: 62)\n   - `getEvaluations()` in `BaseOptimizer` (method_id: 3)\n   - `getIterations()` in `BaseOptimizer` (method_id: 37)\n\nThese methods are critical in determining how the optimization is performed and how the results are evaluated, making them potential sources of the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [30, 54, 62, 3, 37]\n}\n```"
