The test `testFullRank` is designed to validate the behavior of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class, specifically checking the properties of the matrix operations involved in the Cholesky decomposition.\n2. The test fails at the assertion `Assert.assertTrue(root.subtract(base).getNorm() > 0.3);`, indicating that the computed root matrix does not differ significantly from the base matrix, which suggests a potential issue in the matrix operations or the decomposition logic.\n3. The stack trace points to the `RectangularCholeskyDecompositionTest` class, specifically at line 71, which is where the assertion failure occurs.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **RectangularCholeskyDecomposition**: The constructor and the `getRootMatrix` method are critical as they are responsible for the decomposition logic.\n- **AbstractRealMatrix**: The methods `subtract`, `multiply`, and `getNorm` are involved in the operations that lead to the assertion failure.\n- **MatrixUtils**: The methods `checkSubtractionCompatible` and `checkMultiplicationCompatible` ensure that the matrices involved in operations are compatible, which is crucial for the correctness of the operations.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 33, 12, 23, 17, 26]\n}\n```\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **10**: `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` constructor - responsible for initializing the decomposition.\n- **33**: `getRootMatrix` - retrieves the computed root matrix, which is directly involved in the failing assertion.\n- **12**: `subtract` - the method used in the assertion to check the difference between matrices.\n- **23**: `multiply` - involved in matrix operations that could affect the results.\n- **17**: `getNorm` - used to calculate the norm for the assertion.\n- **26**: `checkMultiplicationCompatible` - ensures that the matrices are compatible for multiplication, which is essential for the correctness of the operations. \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify any potential faults leading to the test failure."
