    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testConstructorTooLow` is designed to check the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` with a negative elitism rate. The expected behavior is that an `OutOfRangeException` should be thrown when the elitism rate is out of the valid range. However, the test fails, indicating that the exception is not being thrown as expected.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation`, which calls the constructor of its superclass `ListPopulation`. The constructors of both classes are covered by the failed test.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`ElitisticListPopulation` constructor**: This method is directly involved in the test and is expected to handle the elitism rate correctly.\n2. **`ListPopulation` constructor**: This method is called by the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor and may also play a role in the failure if it does not properly validate the population limit or propagate the exception.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth constructors are suspicious and should be analyzed to determine why the expected exception is not being thrown.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
