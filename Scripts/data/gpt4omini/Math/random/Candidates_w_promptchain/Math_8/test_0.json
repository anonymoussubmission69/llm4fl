The test `testIssue942` is attempting to sample from a `DiscreteDistribution` created with a list of pairs. The test expects the sample size to be 1, but it fails with an `ArrayStoreException`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurs in the `sample` method of the `DiscreteDistribution` class, specifically at line 190.\n3. The `sample` method is responsible for returning an array of sampled objects based on the probabilities defined in the distribution. The error suggests that there is an issue with the types being handled in the array.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`DiscreteDistribution:sample(int sampleSize)`** (method_id: 17): This method is directly involved in the sampling process and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`DiscreteDistribution:sample()`** (method_id: 19): This method is called within the `sample(int sampleSize)` method and is responsible for returning a single sample.\n- **`DiscreteDistribution:<init>(Ljava/util/List;)`** (method_id: 6): The constructor initializes the distribution with the provided samples, and any issues with the input list could propagate to the sampling methods.\n- **`DiscreteDistribution:<init>(Lorg/apache/commons/math3/random/RandomGenerator;Ljava/util/List;)`** (method_id: 14): This constructor also initializes the distribution and could be relevant if the random generator or the list of pairs is not set up correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 14, 17, 19]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are likely candidates for further investigation to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
