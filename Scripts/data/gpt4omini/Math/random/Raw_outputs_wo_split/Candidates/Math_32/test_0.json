"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.threed.PolyhedronsSet:computeGeometricalProperties()`** - This method is directly involved in the computation of geometrical properties, which is where the exception occurs. It is crucial to analyze how it handles the geometrical properties and if it correctly manages the types involved.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.AbstractRegion:getSize()`** - This method is called within the `computeGeometricalProperties()` method and is responsible for returning the size of the region. Any issues in this method could propagate errors to the calling method.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.threed.PolyhedronsSet$FacetsContributionVisitor:addContribution()`** - This method is involved in adding contributions to the facets of the polyhedron, which may also be related to the geometrical properties being computed.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.AbstractRegion:recurseSides()`** - This method is part of the region's side-checking logic and could be involved in determining the boundaries and sizes of regions, which is critical for the geometrical calculations.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.BSPTree:visit()`** - This method is part of the BSP tree traversal and could affect how regions are processed and how their properties are computed.\n\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.AbstractRegion:checkPoint()`** - This method checks the position of points relative to the region, which could influence the geometrical properties being calculated.\n\n7. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.AbstractRegion:insertCuts()`** - This method is responsible for inserting cuts into the region, which is essential for defining the boundaries and could lead to issues if not handled correctly.\n\n8. **`org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.partitioning.BSPTree:insertCut()`** - This method is involved in inserting cuts into the BSP tree, which is fundamental for the partitioning logic and could lead to errors if the cuts are not managed properly.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [51, 56, 155, 30, 77, 175, 82, 71]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test case."
