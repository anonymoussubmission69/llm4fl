"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChromosomeListConstructorTooHigh` is designed to check if an exception is thrown when an invalid elitism rate (1.25) is provided to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The stack trace indicates that an `OutOfRangeException` was expected but not thrown, suggesting that the validation logic in the constructor may not be functioning as intended.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `ListPopulation` constructor, which checks the size of the chromosomes against the population limit.\n2. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor, which calls the `ListPopulation` constructor.\n\nBoth methods are suspicious because:\n- The `ListPopulation` constructor has a condition that checks if the size of chromosomes exceeds the population limit, but it does not seem to handle the elitism rate validation.\n- The `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor directly calls the `ListPopulation` constructor, which may not be validating the elitism rate correctly.\n\nThus, the following methods should be analyzed further:\n- `ListPopulation` constructor (method_id: 0)\n- `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor (method_id: 1)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
