"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testConstructorTooHigh` is designed to check if an `OutOfRangeException` is thrown when an invalid elitism rate is provided to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The stack trace indicates that the exception was expected but not thrown, suggesting a potential issue in the constructor's implementation.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor which initializes the population limit and elitism rate.\n2. `ListPopulation` constructor which checks if the population limit is less than or equal to zero.\n\nBoth methods are suspicious because:\n- The `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor does not seem to validate the `elitismRate`, which could lead to the exception not being thrown as expected.\n- The `ListPopulation` constructor checks for a non-positive population limit, but it does not handle the elitism rate, which might also be a contributing factor to the failure.\n\nThus, the following methods should be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
