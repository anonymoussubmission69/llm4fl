"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testQuinticMin` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected result does not match the actual result. The expected value is `-0.2719561270319131`, but the actual value returned is `-0.2719561299044896`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with the optimization process or the function being optimized.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`optimize`** (method_id: 11) - This method is responsible for performing the optimization. Any issues in the optimization logic could lead to incorrect results.\n2. **`getOptimaValues`** (method_id: 4) - This method retrieves the optimal values computed. If the computation of these values is incorrect, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n3. **`localMin`** (method_id: 6) - This method is likely involved in finding local minima, which is crucial for the optimization process. Any errors here could propagate and affect the final result.\n4. **`computeObjectiveValue`** (method_id: 24) - This method computes the value of the function being optimized. If it does not return the correct value, it will directly affect the optimization outcome.\n5. **`getOptima`** (method_id: 20) - Similar to `getOptimaValues`, this method retrieves the computed optima. If the optima are not computed correctly, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 6, 11, 20, 24]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the discrepancy in the expected and actual results."
