"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testFactorial` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected value of `17!` with the actual value returned by the method. The discrepancy in the values suggests that there may be an issue with the methods involved in calculating the factorial and its logarithm.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are therefore suspicious:\n\n1. **`factorialLog(int n)`**: This method computes the logarithm of the factorial. If there is an error in the logarithmic calculation, it could lead to incorrect results in the test.\n2. **`factorialDouble(int n)`**: This method computes the factorial as a double. It uses `factorialLog` internally, so any issues in `factorialLog` could propagate here.\n3. **`factorial(int n)`**: This method computes the factorial as a long. It relies on `factorialDouble`, so any inaccuracies in that method could also affect the result.\n\nGiven the relationships between these methods, they all need to be analyzed to identify the source of the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
