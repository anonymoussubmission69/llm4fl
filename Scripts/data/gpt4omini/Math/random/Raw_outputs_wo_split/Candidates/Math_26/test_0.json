"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIntegerOverflow` is designed to check for integer overflow conditions when creating a `Fraction` object. The test fails because an exception was expected to be thrown but was not. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `checkIntegerOverflow` method, which is likely responsible for invoking the constructor of the `Fraction` class.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to this test include:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction:<init>(DDII)V`** - This constructor is directly involved in creating a `Fraction` object and contains logic that checks for overflow conditions.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:floor(D)D`** - This method is used within the `Fraction` constructor to compute the floor of a double value, which is critical for determining the numerator.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.exception.FractionConversionException:<init>(DJJ)V`** - This exception is thrown when a conversion overflow occurs, and it is relevant to the failure since the test expects an exception to be thrown.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath:abs(D)D`** - This method is used to compute the absolute value, which may also be involved in the overflow checks.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods involved, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 9, 10]\n}\n``` \n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Method ID 1** (`Fraction:<init>(DDII)V`): This is the constructor where the overflow logic is implemented, making it the primary suspect.\n- **Method ID 0** (`FastMath:floor(D)D`): This method is used to calculate the floor value, which is critical in determining if an overflow occurs.\n- **Method ID 9** (`FractionConversionException:<init>(DJJ)V`): This method is relevant because it handles the exception that should have been thrown during the test.\n- **Method ID 10** (`FastMath:abs(D)D`): This method is used to compute absolute values, which may play a role in the overflow checks. \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify why the expected exception was not thrown during the test."
