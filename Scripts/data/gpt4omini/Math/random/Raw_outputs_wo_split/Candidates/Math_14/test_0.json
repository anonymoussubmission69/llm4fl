"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testLargeSample` is designed to fit a polynomial function to a set of observed points. It uses a `PolynomialFitter` which internally utilizes a `LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer`.\n2. The stack trace indicates an `OutOfMemoryError` occurring in the `BlockRealMatrix` class, specifically in the `createBlocksLayout` method. This suggests that the matrix being created is too large for the available heap space.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace that could potentially lead to this error include:\n   - `BlockRealMatrix.createBlocksLayout`\n   - `BlockRealMatrix.<init>`\n   - `MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix`\n   - `CurveFitter.fit`\n   - `PolynomialFitter.fit`\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n- `BlockRealMatrix.createBlocksLayout` (method_id: 34)\n- `BlockRealMatrix.<init>` (method_id: 14)\n- `MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix` (method_id: 36)\n- `CurveFitter.fit` (method_id: 2)\n- `PolynomialFitter.fit` (method_id: 19)\n\nThese methods are likely contributing to the memory issue, either by creating large matrices or by being part of the fitting process that leads to excessive memory usage.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [34, 14, 36, 2, 19]\n}\n```"
