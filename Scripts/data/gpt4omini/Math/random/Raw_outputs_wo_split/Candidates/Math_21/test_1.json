"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testFullRank` is designed to verify the behavior of the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class, specifically its ability to compute the root matrix and validate its properties.\n2. The test fails at the assertion `Assert.assertTrue(root.subtract(base).getNorm() > 0.3);`, indicating that the computed root matrix does not differ significantly from the base matrix, which suggests a potential issue in the computation of the root matrix.\n3. The stack trace points to the `RectangularCholeskyDecompositionTest` class, specifically at line 71, which corresponds to the assertion that failed.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()**: This method is directly involved in obtaining the root matrix, which is critical to the test.\n- **RectangularCholeskyDecomposition constructor**: The constructor initializes the decomposition and may contain logic that could lead to incorrect results if there are issues with the input matrix.\n- **AbstractRealMatrix.subtract()**: This method is used to compute the difference between the root matrix and the base matrix, and any issues here could affect the assertion.\n- **AbstractRealMatrix.getNorm()**: This method calculates the norm of the matrix, which is used in the assertion. If the norm calculation is incorrect, it could lead to a false failure in the test.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 33, 12, 17]\n}\n``` \n\n- **10**: RectangularCholeskyDecomposition constructor\n- **33**: RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()\n- **12**: AbstractRealMatrix.subtract()\n- **17**: AbstractRealMatrix.getNorm()"
