"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath679` is failing because it expects an exception `NumberIsTooLargeException` to be thrown when creating an instance of `OpenMapRealMatrix` with parameters `(3, Integer.MAX_VALUE)`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs during the instantiation of `OpenMapRealMatrix`, which suggests that the constructor of this class is likely where the fault lies.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include the constructor of `OpenMapRealMatrix`, as well as several other methods that are invoked during its execution. The following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **OpenMapRealMatrix constructor**: This is the method directly involved in the test and is expected to throw the exception.\n2. **OpenIntToDoubleHashMap constructor**: This method is called within the `OpenMapRealMatrix` constructor and may contribute to the issue if it does not handle the parameters correctly.\n3. **AbstractRealMatrix constructor**: This method is also called within the `OpenMapRealMatrix` constructor and may have conditions that lead to the exception.\n4. **computeCapacity method**: This method is called within the `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap` constructor and may affect how the internal structures are initialized based on the parameters passed.\n\nThe other methods (`ceil`, `floor`, and the second `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap` constructor) are less likely to be directly related to the fault since they do not seem to be invoked in the context of the failing test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 5]\n}\n``` \n\n- **0**: `OpenMapRealMatrix:<init>(II)V` - Directly involved in the test.\n- **1**: `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:<init>(ID)V` - Called within the `OpenMapRealMatrix` constructor.\n- **2**: `AbstractRealMatrix:<init>(II)V` - Also called within the `OpenMapRealMatrix` constructor.\n- **5**: `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:computeCapacity(I)I` - Affects the initialization of the `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap`."
