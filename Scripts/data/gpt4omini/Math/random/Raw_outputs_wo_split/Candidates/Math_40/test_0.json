"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIssue716` is attempting to solve a mathematical problem using the `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver`. The test fails due to a `TooManyEvaluationsException`, which indicates that the maximum evaluation count (100) was exceeded during the solving process.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the exception is thrown from the `incrementEvaluationCount` method in the `BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver` class, which is called during the `computeObjectiveValue` method. This suggests that the issue may be related to how the solver is configured or how the function is evaluated.\n\n3. The methods that are directly involved in the failure include:\n   - `incrementEvaluationCount()`\n   - `computeObjectiveValue(double point)`\n   - `doSolve()`\n   - `solve(int maxEval, UnivariateFunction f, double min, double max, double startValue)`\n\n4. Additionally, the `setup` method is responsible for initializing the solver with the maximum evaluation count, which could also be a point of interest.\n\n5. The methods related to the evaluation count and the function being solved are critical to understanding why the maximum count was exceeded.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 15, 25, 29]\n}\n``` \n\n- **0**: `setup(int maxEval, UnivariateFunction f, double min, double max, double startValue)`\n- **2**: `doSolve()`\n- **15**: `incrementEvaluationCount()`\n- **25**: `computeObjectiveValue(double point)`\n- **29**: `solve(int maxEval, UnivariateFunction f, double min, double max, double startValue)` \n\nThese methods are crucial in understanding the evaluation process and the conditions under which the exception was thrown."
