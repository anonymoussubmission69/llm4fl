"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` is designed to check the parsing of a string representation of a fraction. The test expects a `ParseException` to be thrown when an invalid input (in this case, \"2 -2 / 3\") is provided. However, the test fails because the exception is not thrown, indicating that there is a fault in the parsing logic.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the `parse` method of the `FractionFormat` class, which is responsible for parsing the string input into a `Fraction` object. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various constructors and parsing methods related to `FractionFormat` and `ProperFractionFormat`.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`FractionFormat:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/text/ParsePosition;)Lorg/apache/commons/math/fraction/Fraction;` (method_id: 11)** - This method is directly responsible for parsing the input string and is where the failure occurs.\n2. **`ProperFractionFormat:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/text/ParsePosition;)Lorg/apache/commons/math/fraction/Fraction;` (method_id: 17)** - This method extends the parsing functionality and may also be involved in the parsing logic.\n3. **`FractionFormat:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/apache/commons/math/fraction/Fraction;` (method_id: 15)** - This method is a higher-level method that calls the lower-level parse method and may also contribute to the failure.\n4. **`Fraction:reduce()V` (method_id: 5)** - This method is responsible for reducing the fraction and may be indirectly related if the parsing logic does not handle invalid inputs correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [11, 17, 15, 5]\n}\n```"
