"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is failing due to an assertion that expected a certain value but received `NaN` instead. The test is specifically checking the `tan()` method of a `Complex` object, which indicates that the issue likely lies within the implementation of the `tan()` method or its dependencies.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several mathematical functions, particularly from the `FastMath` class, which are used in the computation of the tangent function. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`tan()`** - This is the method being directly tested and is likely where the fault originates.\n2. **`sin()`** - This method is called within the `tan()` method and could be contributing to the `NaN` result.\n3. **`cos()`** - This method is also called within the `tan()` method and could similarly affect the output.\n4. **`cosh()`** - This method is used in the calculation of the tangent and could lead to issues if it returns unexpected values.\n5. **`sinQ()`** - This method is used in the `cos()` method and could propagate errors if it does not handle inputs correctly.\n6. **`polySine()`** and **`polyCosine()`** - These methods are used for polynomial approximations of sine and cosine, respectively, and could introduce inaccuracies leading to `NaN`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [13, 4, 9, 8, 10, 7, 1]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes the `tan()` method and its dependencies that are likely to be involved in the computation leading to the failure. Each of these methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the `NaN` result."
