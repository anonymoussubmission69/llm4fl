"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testTanInf` is failing due to an assertion that expected a certain value but received `NaN`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `tan()` method of the `Complex` class, which is likely where the issue originates.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several mathematical functions from the `FastMath` utility class, as well as methods from the `Complex` class. The methods that are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`tan()`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is where the failure occurred.\n2. **`sin()`** - This method is called within the `tan()` method and could be contributing to the `NaN` result.\n3. **`cos()`** - This method is also called within the `tan()` method and could similarly affect the output.\n4. **`sinQ()`** and **`cosQ()`** - These methods are used for more precise sine and cosine calculations and could be involved in the propagation of the error.\n5. **`createComplex()`** - This method is responsible for creating complex numbers and could be involved if the inputs are not valid.\n6. **`valueOf()`** - This method is used to create complex numbers from real and imaginary parts and could also be a source of invalid values.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [12, 4, 7, 8, 2, 9]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
