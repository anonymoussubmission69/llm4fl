"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDoubleValueForLargeNumeratorAndDenominator` is failing because it expected a value of `5.0` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the calculation of the double value in the `doubleValue()` method of the `BigFraction` class.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **Constructor of `BigFraction`**: This method initializes the `BigFraction` object and checks for null values and zero denominators. If the denominator is zero, it could lead to undefined behavior in the `doubleValue()` method.\n   \n2. **`checkNotNull` method**: This utility method checks if an object is null. While it seems straightforward, if the `denominator` is not properly validated before being passed to the `BigFraction` constructor, it could lead to issues.\n\n3. **`doubleValue()` method**: This method performs the division of the numerator by the denominator. If the denominator is zero or if the values are too large, it could result in `NaN`.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be investigated further are:\n\n- `BigFraction.<init>(BigInteger, BigInteger)` (method_id: 0)\n- `MathUtils.checkNotNull(Object, Localizable)` (method_id: 1)\n- `BigFraction.doubleValue()` (method_id: 2)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
