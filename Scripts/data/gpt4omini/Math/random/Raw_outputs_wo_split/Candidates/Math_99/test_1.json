"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testGcd()` is designed to test the `gcd` method from the `MathUtils` class. The test is failing specifically when it expects an `ArithmeticException` to be thrown for the input `MathUtils.gcd(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 0)`, but it does not occur, leading to an assertion failure.\n\n2. The covered method identified is `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)`. The implementation of this method includes checks for zero values and handles negative inputs, but it seems to lack proper handling for the case of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` when paired with zero, which is likely the source of the fault.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is:\n\n- `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)`\n\nThis method is directly related to the failure observed in the test case, and its logic should be scrutinized to ensure it correctly handles edge cases, particularly with respect to the minimum integer value.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
