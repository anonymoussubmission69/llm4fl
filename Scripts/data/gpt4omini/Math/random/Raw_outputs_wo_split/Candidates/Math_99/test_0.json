"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is focused on the `lcm` (Least Common Multiple) method from the `MathUtils` class. The test is failing because it expects an `ArithmeticException` when calling `MathUtils.lcm(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 1)`, but it does not receive this exception.\n\n2. The `lcm` method checks for zero values and returns zero if either input is zero. However, it does not handle the case where the inputs are extreme values like `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which could lead to an overflow when calculating the LCM.\n\n3. The `gcd` (Greatest Common Divisor) method is also covered in the test, as it is used within the `lcm` method. If there is an issue with how `gcd` handles its inputs, it could propagate to the `lcm` method.\n\n4. The `mulAndCheck` method is responsible for checking the multiplication of two integers to prevent overflow. If this method does not correctly handle the multiplication of extreme values, it could also lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nGiven these points, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `MathUtils.lcm(int a, int b)` - The primary method under test that is expected to throw an exception.\n- `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)` - A helper method that could affect the behavior of `lcm`.\n- `MathUtils.mulAndCheck(int x, int y)` - A method that checks for overflow during multiplication, which is critical for the correctness of `lcm`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
