"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMath280` is testing the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class. The test expects a specific result (2.0) for the input probability (0.9772498680518209).\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `MathException` occurred due to a `ConvergenceException`, which suggests that the method did not converge within the allowed iterations.\n3. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method is part of the `AbstractContinuousDistribution` class, which is likely where the convergence logic is implemented.\n4. The `cumulativeProbability` method is called within `inverseCumulativeProbability`, which could also be a source of the issue if it does not return expected values.\n5. The `logGamma` and `regularizedGammaP` methods are also involved in the calculations, as they are used in the computation of probabilities and could potentially lead to convergence issues.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. `inverseCumulativeProbability` (method_id: 26)\n2. `cumulativeProbability` (method_id: 6)\n3. `logGamma` (method_id: 0)\n4. `regularizedGammaP` (method_id: 17)\n5. `Gamma:erf` (method_id: 1)\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [26, 6, 0, 17, 1]\n}\n```"
