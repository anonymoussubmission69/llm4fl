"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMinMaxFloat` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the maximum values of two floats. The specific failure is:\n\n```\nmax(50.0, -50.0) expected:<50.0> but was:<-50.0>\n```\n\nThis indicates that the method responsible for calculating the maximum value is not functioning correctly. The relevant methods that are covered by the failed test include:\n\n1. `org.apache.commons.math.util.FastMath:max(FF)F` - This method is directly involved in calculating the maximum of two float values.\n2. `org.apache.commons.math.util.FastMath:min(FF)F` - Although not directly implicated in the failure, it is part of the same test and may have related logic.\n3. `org.apache.commons.math.util.FastMath:max(II)I` - This method calculates the maximum of two integers, which may not be directly related but is part of the same utility class.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the most suspicious method to analyze further is `FastMath:max(FF)F`, as it is directly responsible for the erroneous output.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 8]\n}\n```\n\n- Method ID `1` corresponds to `FastMath:max(FF)F`, which is the primary suspect for the failure.\n- Method ID `8` corresponds to `FastMath:min(FF)F`, which may also be relevant for understanding the overall logic in the context of min/max calculations."
