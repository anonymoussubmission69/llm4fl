"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` is attempting to create an instance of `FDistributionImpl` and call its `inverseCumulativeProbability` method. \n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to invalid endpoint parameters, specifically mentioning `lowerBound=0.0` and `initial=-1.0`.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `bracket` from `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`\n   - `inverseCumulativeProbability` from `AbstractContinuousDistribution`\n   - `inverseCumulativeProbability` from `FDistributionImpl`\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `FDistributionImpl` class, as well as utility methods from `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` and `Gamma`.\n\n### Suspicious Methods\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability` (FDistributionImpl)** - This method is directly involved in the test and is where the exception is thrown.\n2. **`bracket` (UnivariateRealSolverUtils)** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is likely responsible for the invalid parameters.\n3. **`getInitialDomain` (FDistributionImpl)** - This method is used to determine the initial domain for the distribution and could be contributing to the invalid parameters.\n4. **`setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` (FDistributionImpl)** - This method sets the degrees of freedom and could be related to the invalid state of the distribution.\n5. **`setNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom` (FDistributionImpl)** - Similar to the previous method, this could also affect the state of the distribution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 1, 2, 10, 23]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the failure and their potential to propagate the fault through the system."
