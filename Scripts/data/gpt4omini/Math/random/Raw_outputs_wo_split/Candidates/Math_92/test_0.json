"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBinomialCoefficientLarge` is designed to validate the behavior of the `binomialCoefficient` method from the `MathUtils` class. The test checks both the expected results and whether exceptions are thrown for various inputs. The stack trace indicates that there was an assertion failure when comparing the expected and actual results of the binomial coefficient calculation for the inputs (48, 22).\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`binomialCoefficient(int n, int k)`** - This method is directly involved in calculating the binomial coefficient and is the primary suspect since the test is failing on its output.\n2. **`binomialCoefficientDouble(int n, int k)`** - This method is called within `binomialCoefficient` to compute the result using logarithmic calculations. Any inaccuracies in this method could lead to incorrect results in `binomialCoefficient`.\n3. **`binomialCoefficientLog(int n, int k)`** - This method is responsible for calculating the logarithm of the binomial coefficient. If there are issues in this method, it could propagate errors to the `binomialCoefficientDouble` and subsequently to `binomialCoefficient`.\n4. **`addAndCheck(long a, long b)`** - This method is used for addition with overflow checks. If there are any issues with addition, it could affect the calculations in the binomial coefficient methods.\n5. **`addAndCheck(long a, long b, String msg)`** - Similar to the previous method, this private method also handles addition with overflow checks and could be a source of error if not functioning correctly.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 2, 1, 0, 3]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 4**: `binomialCoefficient(int n, int k)` - Directly responsible for the output.\n- **Method ID 2**: `binomialCoefficientDouble(int n, int k)` - Used for calculations in `binomialCoefficient`.\n- **Method ID 1**: `binomialCoefficientLog(int n, int k)` - Provides logarithmic calculations for `binomialCoefficientDouble`.\n- **Method ID 0**: `addAndCheck(long a, long b)` - Handles addition with overflow checks.\n- **Method ID 3**: `addAndCheck(long a, long b, String msg)` - Similar to the previous method, also handles addition with overflow checks."
