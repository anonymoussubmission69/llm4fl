"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath905LargeNegative` is failing due to an assertion that expected a maximum error (`maxErr`) of `0.0`, but instead received `Infinity`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the calculations performed in the methods being tested, particularly those related to hyperbolic functions (`cosh` and `sinh`) and possibly the handling of large negative values.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `FastMath.cosh(double x)`\n2. `FastMath.sinh(double x)`\n3. `FastMath.abs(double x)`\n4. `FastMath.max(int a, int b)`\n5. `FastMath.ulp(double x)`\n6. `FastMath.exp(double x)`\n\nGiven that the test is specifically checking the behavior of `FastMath.cosh` and `FastMath.sinh` for large negative inputs, these methods are the most suspicious. Additionally, the `FastMath.exp` method is also relevant since it is used within the `cosh` and `sinh` implementations. The `ulp` method is involved in the error calculation, and `abs` and `max` are used in the error handling, making them potentially relevant as well.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 19, 1, 2, 9, 14]\n}\n```\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Method IDs 4 (cosh) and 19 (exp)**: Directly involved in the calculations that lead to the assertion failure.\n- **Method ID 1 (abs)**: Used in the error calculation, which is critical to the test's assertion.\n- **Method ID 2 (max)**: Also used in the error calculation, relevant for determining the maximum error.\n- **Method ID 9 (ulp)**: Important for understanding the precision of the calculations.\n- **Method ID 14 (max with doubles)**: Relevant for handling maximum values in the context of the test.\n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure."
