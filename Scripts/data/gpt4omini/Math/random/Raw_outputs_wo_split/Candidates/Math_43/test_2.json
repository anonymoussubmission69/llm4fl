"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideMeanWithMathClass` is failing because it expected a mean value of `2.5` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the mean, which is being handled by the `Mean` class and its associated methods.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Mean:evaluate** - This method is responsible for calculating the mean from the provided values. If it returns `NaN`, it suggests that there may be an issue with how the mean is being computed.\n2. **SummaryStatistics:getMean** - This method retrieves the mean value from the `meanImpl`. If `meanImpl` is not set correctly or if it is not an instance of `Mean`, it could lead to incorrect results.\n3. **Mean:getResult** - This method returns the result of the mean calculation. If the underlying moment is not set correctly, it could return `NaN`.\n4. **SummaryStatistics:addValue** - This method adds a value to the statistics. If there is an issue with how values are being added or if the mean implementation is not set correctly, it could affect the mean calculation.\n5. **SummaryStatistics:setMeanImpl** - This method sets the mean implementation. If it is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect mean calculations.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 3, 4, 7, 25]\n}\n```"
