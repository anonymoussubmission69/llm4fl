"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` is failing due to an assertion that expected a specific geometric mean value but received `NaN`. This indicates that somewhere in the computation of the geometric mean, an invalid operation is likely occurring, leading to a `NaN` result.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`getGeometricMean()`** (method_id: 2): This method is directly involved in retrieving the geometric mean, which is the final output being asserted in the test. If it returns `NaN`, it is crucial to investigate why.\n\n2. **`getResult()`** (method_id: 8): This method is called within `getGeometricMean()` and is responsible for returning the result of the geometric mean calculation. If it returns `NaN`, it is essential to check its implementation.\n\n3. **`evaluate(double[] values, int begin, int length)`** (method_id: 22): This method is likely involved in the calculation of the geometric mean, as it processes the input values. If there are issues with the input values or the way they are processed, it could lead to a `NaN` result.\n\n4. **`increment(double d)`** in `SumOfLogs` (method_id: 28): This method is responsible for updating the sum of logarithms, which is a critical part of calculating the geometric mean. If it encounters a negative or zero value, it could lead to invalid results.\n\n5. **`log(double x)`** (method_id: 0): This method is used to compute the logarithm of values. If it receives a non-positive value, it will return `NaN`, which would propagate through the calculations.\n\n6. **`addValue(double value)`** (method_id: 5): This method adds a value to the statistics and calls several increment methods. If any of these increments fail or produce invalid results, it could affect the final geometric mean.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 8, 22, 28, 0, 5]\n}\n```"
