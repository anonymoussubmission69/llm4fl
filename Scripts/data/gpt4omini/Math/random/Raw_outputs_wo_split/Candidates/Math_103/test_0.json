"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testExtremeValues` is designed to test the `cumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistribution` class with extreme values of `x`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `MaxIterationsExceededException` was thrown, which suggests that the method `regularizedGammaP` in the `Gamma` class is likely involved in a loop that exceeds the maximum number of iterations.\n3. The `cumulativeProbability` method calls the `erf` method, which in turn calls `regularizedGammaP`. This indicates a chain of method calls that could lead to the exception.\n4. The methods involved in this chain are:\n   - `cumulativeProbability` (method_id: 7)\n   - `erf` (method_id: 1)\n   - `regularizedGammaP` (method_id: 2)\n   - `logGamma` (method_id: 0)\n\nGiven this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be investigated further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their involvement in the stack trace and their potential to propagate the fault leading to the `MaxIterationsExceededException`."
