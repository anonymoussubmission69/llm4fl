"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failure is related to a chi-square test statistic that is not matching the expected value. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `testChiSquare` method of the `ChiSquareTestTest` class, which suggests that the methods involved in calculating the chi-square statistic are likely to be the source of the issue.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)** - This method is responsible for performing the chi-square test and is directly related to the test failure.\n2. **ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)** - This method seems to be involved in the calculation of the chi-square statistic.\n3. **ChiSquaredDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(double x)** - This method is called within the chi-square test implementation and could affect the final result.\n4. **GammaDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(double x)** - This method is also involved in the calculation of probabilities related to the chi-square distribution.\n5. **ChiSquaredDistributionImpl:setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)** - This method sets the degrees of freedom for the chi-square distribution, which is crucial for the test's accuracy.\n\nGiven the relationships and the nature of the failure, these methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the discrepancy in the chi-square test statistic.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 27, 22, 1, 5]\n}\n```"
