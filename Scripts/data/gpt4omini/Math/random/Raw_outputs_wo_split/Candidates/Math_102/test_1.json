"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.TestUtils:chiSquare([D[J)D` (method_id: 1)**: This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic. The test failure indicates that the expected value does not match the actual value returned by this method.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquareTest([D[J)D` (method_id: 6)**: This method is called within the `chiSquare` method and is responsible for performing the chi-square test. Any issues in this method could propagate to the `chiSquare` method.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl:chiSquare([D[J)D` (method_id: 35)**: This method is also involved in the chi-square calculation and could be a source of error if the implementation is incorrect.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math.distribution.ChiSquaredDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D` (method_id: 28)**: This method is called within the `chiSquareTest` method and is responsible for calculating the cumulative probability, which is crucial for the chi-square test.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math.special.Gamma:logGamma(D)D` (method_id: 33)**: This method is used in the calculation of the gamma function, which is often involved in statistical calculations, including chi-square tests.\n\n6. **`org.apache.commons.math.special.Gamma:regularizedGammaP(DD)D` (method_id: 22)**: This method is also related to gamma functions and could affect the results of the chi-square calculations.\n\n7. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl:isPositive([D)Z` (method_id: 14)**: This method checks if the expected values are positive, which is a prerequisite for the chi-square test. If it incorrectly identifies values, it could lead to erroneous results.\n\n8. **`org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl:isNonNegative([J)Z` (method_id: 16)**: Similar to the previous method, this checks if observed values are non-negative, which is also critical for the test's validity.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 6, 35, 28, 33, 22, 14, 16]\n}\n```"
