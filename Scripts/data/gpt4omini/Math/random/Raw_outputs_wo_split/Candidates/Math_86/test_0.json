"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNotPositiveDefinite` is expected to throw a `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException`. The test fails because this exception is not thrown, indicating that there may be an issue in the methods related to matrix operations, particularly in the Cholesky decomposition implementation.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **CholeskyDecompositionImpl constructor**: This method is responsible for initializing the Cholesky decomposition and checking if the matrix is square and positive definite. If the matrix is not positive definite, it should throw the `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException`.\n   - Method ID: 14\n\n2. **getL()**: This method retrieves the lower triangular matrix L from the decomposition. If the decomposition has not been performed correctly, this could lead to issues.\n   - Method ID: 13\n\n3. **getLT()**: This method retrieves the transpose of the lower triangular matrix. Similar to `getL()`, if the decomposition is incorrect, this could also lead to problems.\n   - Method ID: 21\n\n4. **isSquare()**: This method checks if the matrix is square. If the matrix is not square, the decomposition cannot proceed correctly.\n   - Method ID: 16\n\n5. **createRealMatrix()**: This method creates a real matrix from a 2D array. If the input matrix is not valid, it could lead to issues in the decomposition.\n   - Method ID: 6\n\n6. **checkMultiplicationCompatible()**: This method checks if two matrices can be multiplied. If the dimensions are not compatible, it could lead to runtime exceptions.\n   - Method ID: 1\n\n7. **multiply()**: This method performs matrix multiplication. If the matrices involved are not valid, it could lead to incorrect results or exceptions.\n   - Method ID: 15\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 13, 21, 16, 6, 1, 15]\n}\n```"
