    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testExtremeValues` is designed to check the behavior of the `cumulativeProbability` method of a `NormalDistribution` class when given extreme values. The stack trace indicates that a `ConvergenceException` occurred due to a \"Continued fraction diverged to NaN for value \u221e\", which suggests that the issue arises from the handling of extreme values in the calculations.\n\n2. The methods involved in the stack trace include `cumulativeProbability`, `regularizedGammaP`, `erf`, and `evaluate`. These methods are interconnected, as `cumulativeProbability` relies on `erf`, which in turn calls `regularizedGammaP`.\n\n3. The methods will be ranked based on their potential to cause the observed exception, focusing on how they handle extreme values and their mathematical computations.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The cumulativeProbability method is directly involved in the test that failed.
