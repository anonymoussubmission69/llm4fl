    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` is failing because the expected chi-square test statistic does not match the actual computed value. The expected value is `114875.90421929007`, while the actual value returned is `3624883.3429077636`.
