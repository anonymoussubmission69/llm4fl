This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the parameters are being checked or handled, particularly in relation to the boundaries set for the optimization process.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'checkParameters' is responsible for validating the bounds of the parameters.
