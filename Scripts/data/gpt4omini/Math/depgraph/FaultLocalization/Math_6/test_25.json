The test `testSsDiffPow` failed due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected output did not match the actual output. The methods were examined for their roles in the optimization process, particularly focusing on how they handle parameters, fitness evaluation, and convergence checks.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'doOptimize' method is central to the optimization process, handling iterations and fitness evaluations.
