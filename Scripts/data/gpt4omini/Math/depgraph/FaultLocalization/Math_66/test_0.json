    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `testQuinticMinStatistics` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected value is `1880.5` but the actual value returned is `18.0`. This indicates that there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization results, particularly in the evaluation of the optimizer's performance metrics.\n\nThe methods that are most relevant to this failure are those that deal with optimization, evaluation, and statistical calculations.
