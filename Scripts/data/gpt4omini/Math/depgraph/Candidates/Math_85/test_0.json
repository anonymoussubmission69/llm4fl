The test `testMath280` is testing the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistributionImpl` class. The test expects a specific output (2.0) for the input (0.9772498680518209).\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `MathException` occurred, specifically a `ConvergenceException`, which suggests that the method did not converge to a solution within the allowed iterations.\n3. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method calls other methods, including `getDomainLowerBound`, `getDomainUpperBound`, and potentially methods from `UnivariateRealSolverUtils` for bracketing.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability` (method_id: 6)** - This is the method directly being tested and is where the exception originated.\n2. **`bracket` (method_id: 0 and 1)** - These methods are responsible for finding a bracket for the root-finding algorithm. If they do not find a valid bracket, it could lead to convergence issues.\n3. **`getDomainLowerBound` (method_id: 3)** and **`getDomainUpperBound` (method_id: 4)** - These methods determine the bounds for the probability input, which are critical for the bracketing process.\n4. **`cumulativeProbability` (method_id: 10)** - This method is used within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and could affect the outcome if it does not return expected values.\n5. **`setStandardDeviation` (method_id: 16)** - If the standard deviation is set incorrectly, it could lead to issues in the calculations performed in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 0, 1, 3, 4, 10, 16]\n}\n```"
