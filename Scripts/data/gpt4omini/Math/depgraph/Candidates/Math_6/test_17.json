Any issues here could lead to incorrect optimization results.\n3. **CMAESOptimizer:initializeCMA()** - This method initializes parameters for the CMA-ES algorithm. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to failures in the optimization process.\n4. **CMAESOptimizer:checkParameters()** - This method checks the parameters for validity. If there are issues with the parameters, it could lead to unexpected behavior during optimization.\n5. **CMAESOptimizer:optimize()** - This method is the entry point for the optimization process. Any issues here could propagate to the entire optimization routine.\n6. **CMAESOptimizer:FitnessFunction:value()** - This method computes the fitness value for a given point. If the fitness function is not correctly implemented, it could lead to incorrect optimization results.\n7. **CMAESOptimizer:push()** - This method manages the history of fitness values. If there are issues with how values are pushed or managed, it could affect the optimization process.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 32, 30, 26, 55, 41]\n}\n```"
