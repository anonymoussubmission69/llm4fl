    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` is failing because the expected geometric mean value is `2.213363839400643`, but the actual result is `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the geometric mean.\n\n2. The method `evaluate` in the `GeometricMean` class is directly involved in the calculation of the geometric mean. The stack trace shows that the failure occurs when this method is called.\n\n3. The `evaluate` method in `GeometricMean` calls `FastMath.exp`, which is also covered in the failed test. If the input to `FastMath.exp` is not handled correctly, it could lead to a `NaN` result.\n\n4. The `addValue` method in `SummaryStatistics` is responsible for adding values to the statistics, and it calls several increment methods, including those for geometric mean, which could also be a source of the issue.\n\n5. The `getGeometricMean` method in `SummaryStatistics` retrieves the result from the `geoMeanImpl`, which is set to an instance of `GeometricMean`. If the `geoMeanImpl` is not correctly initialized or if it encounters an issue during its calculations, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\nBased on these observations, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `GeometricMean:evaluate([DII)D` (method_id: 0)\n- `FastMath:exp(DD[D)D` (method_id: 1)\n- `SummaryStatistics:addValue(D)V` (method_id: 5)\n- `SummaryStatistics:getGeometricMean()D` (method_id: 4)\n- `GeometricMean:getResult()D` (method_id: 28)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 5, 28]\n}\n```"
