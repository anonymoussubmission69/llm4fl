    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is failing due to an assertion error where the expected chi-square test statistic does not match the actual value returned. The relevant methods involved in this computation are primarily from the `ChiSquareTestImpl` class.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic. Any issues in the logic here could directly lead to incorrect results.\n2. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method likely calls the `chiSquare` method and is involved in the overall chi-square test process.\n3. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if all values in the expected array are positive. If it incorrectly returns true when it shouldn't, it could affect the chi-square calculation.\n4. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - Similar to `isPositive`, this method checks if all observed values are non-negative. An incorrect return value could also affect the calculations.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could propagate and lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n```"
