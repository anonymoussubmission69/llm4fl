It calls the `Erf.erf()` method, which is also implicated in the stack trace.\n2. **`setStandardDeviation(double sd)`**: This method sets the standard deviation, and if it is set to a non-positive value, it could lead to issues in the calculations performed in `cumulativeProbability`.\n3. **`setMean(double mean)`**: This method sets the mean value, which is also critical for the calculations in `cumulativeProbability`.\n4. **`Gamma.regularizedGammaP(double a, double x, double epsilon, int maxIterations)`**: This method is called within `Erf.erf()` and is responsible for the iterations that lead to the `MaxIterationsExceededException`.\n5. **`Erf.erf(double x)`**: This method is called within `cumulativeProbability` and is responsible for computing the error function, which is critical for the normal distribution calculations.\n\nThe methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the failure and their potential to propagate the fault:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 6, 10]\n}\n``` \n\n- **0**: `cumulativeProbability(double x)` - Directly throws the exception.\n- **1**: `setStandardDeviation(double sd)` - Affects the calculations in `cumulativeProbability`.\n- **2**: `setMean(double mean)` - Affects the calculations in `cumulativeProbability`.\n- **6**: `Erf.erf(double x)` - Called within `cumulativeProbability`, involved in the error function calculation.\n- **10**: `Gamma.regularizedGammaP(double a, double x, double epsilon, int maxIterations)` - Responsible for the iterations leading to the exception."
