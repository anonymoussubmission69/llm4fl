    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSSENonNegative` is designed to check that the sum of squared errors (SSE) calculated by the `SimpleRegression` class is non-negative. The test fails with an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the assertion `reg.getSumSquaredErrors() >= 0.0` is not satisfied.\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test are:\n1. `addData(double x, double y)`: This method is responsible for adding data points to the regression model. It updates various statistics used to calculate the SSE.\n2. `getSumSquaredErrors()`: This method calculates and returns the sum of squared errors.\n3. `SimpleRegression()`: This is the constructor for the `SimpleRegression` class, which initializes the object.\n\nGiven that the failure is related to the calculation of SSE, the most suspicious methods to analyze further are `addData` and `getSumSquaredErrors`. The constructor is less likely to be the source of the fault unless it fails to initialize the object correctly, but it is still worth noting.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n``` \n\nIn this case, method ID 0 corresponds to `addData`, and method ID 1 corresponds to `getSumSquaredErrors`. These methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
