    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath1021` is failing due to an assertion that checks if the sampled value from the `HypergeometricDistribution` is within the expected range. The stack trace indicates that the sample returned a value of -50, which is outside the expected range of 0 to n (where n is 50).\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **`calculateNumericalVariance()`** - This method calculates the variance, which could affect the sampling distribution.\n2. **`getNumericalVariance()`** - This method retrieves the numerical variance, which is calculated using `calculateNumericalVariance()`.\n3. **`getNumericalMean()`** - This method calculates the mean, which is also crucial for the distribution.\n4. **`getSupportUpperBound()`** - This method determines the upper bound of the support for the distribution, which is critical for validating the sampled value.\n5. **`getSupportLowerBound()`** - This method determines the lower bound of the support for the distribution, which is also critical for validating the sampled value.\n6. **`sample()`** - This method is directly responsible for generating the sample that is being tested.\n7. **`inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** - This method is involved in determining the sample based on the cumulative probability, which could lead to incorrect sampling if not implemented correctly.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is likely that the issue lies in how the distribution is defined or how the sampling is performed, particularly in the methods that calculate variance, mean, and bounds.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 12]\n}\n```"
