The test `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` is attempting to calculate the cumulative probability and then the inverse cumulative probability using the `FDistributionImpl` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to invalid endpoint parameters in the `bracket` method of `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`, which is called from the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of `AbstractContinuousDistribution`.\n3. The `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in `FDistributionImpl` is also involved, which suggests that the issue may stem from the parameters being passed to it.\n4. The `getInitialDomain` method in `FDistributionImpl` is responsible for determining the initial domain, which could also be a source of the problem if it returns an invalid value.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D` (method_id: 2)\n2. `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D` (method_id: 1)\n3. `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils:bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDDI)[D` (method_id: 5)\n4. `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl:getInitialDomain(D)D` (method_id: 3)\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and the fault may propagate through them, leading to the exception observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 3, 5]\n}\n```"
