    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath905LargeNegative` is failing due to an assertion that expected a maximum error of `0.0`, but instead received `Infinity`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the calculations performed in the methods being tested, specifically in the `FastMath.cosh` and `FastMath.sinh` methods.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `FastMath.cosh(double x)`\n2. `FastMath.sinh(double x)`\n3. `FastMath.exp(double x)`\n4. `FastMath.max(double a, double b)`\n5. `FastMath.ulp(double x)`\n\nThe methods `FastMath.cosh` and `FastMath.sinh` are directly involved in the calculations that led to the failure. The `exp` method is also critical since it is used within the `cosh` and `sinh` methods. The `max` and `ulp` methods are used for error calculations and could also contribute to the issue if they are not handling edge cases correctly.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. `FastMath.cosh(double x)` - Directly involved in the test.\n2. `FastMath.sinh(double x)` - Directly involved in the test.\n3. `FastMath.exp(double x)` - Used in the calculations of `cosh` and `sinh`.\n4. `FastMath.max(double a, double b)` - Used for error calculations.\n5. `FastMath.ulp(double x)` - Used for error calculations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe methods listed above are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 5, 2, 3]\n}\n```"
