Any issues in the integration logic could lead to incorrect evaluations.\n2. **EventState:evaluateStep** - This method is responsible for evaluating the step during the integration process. If there are issues in how events are evaluated, it could affect the overall integration results.\n3. **BrentSolver:solve** - This method is used to find roots of functions, which is critical in the context of numerical methods. If the root-finding logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect results.\n4. **CombinedEventsManager:evaluateStep** - This method manages event handling during integration. Any issues here could lead to incorrect event evaluations, affecting the integration process.\n5. **NordsieckStepInterpolator:rescale** - This method rescales the interpolated values, which is crucial for maintaining accuracy in the integration process. Errors in rescaling could propagate through the calculations.\n6. **AdamsMoultonIntegrator$Corrector:end** - This method calculates the error at the end of the correction process. If the error calculation is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect adjustments in the integration process.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 29]\n}\n```"
