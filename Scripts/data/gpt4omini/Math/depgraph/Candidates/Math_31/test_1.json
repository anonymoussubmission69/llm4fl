    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath785` is failing due to inaccurate results from the `ContinuedFraction` class, specifically when calculating the inverse cumulative probability using the `FDistribution` class. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method is called, which relies on several other methods.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.math3.util.ContinuedFraction:evaluate(DDI)D`** - This method is directly related to the calculation of continued fractions, which is crucial for the accuracy of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This method is the one being tested and is directly responsible for the failure.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.AbstractRealDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)D`** - This method is a superclass method that may contain logic affecting the behavior of `FDistribution`.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.analysis.solvers.UnivariateSolverUtils:solve(Lorg/apache/commons/math3/analysis/UnivariateFunction;DDD)D`** - This method is used to solve the equation in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, and any issues here could propagate to the failure.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.analysis.solvers.BrentSolver:doSolve()D`** - This method is part of the solving process and could be a source of inaccuracies if the implementation is flawed.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 18, 20, 19, 24]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
