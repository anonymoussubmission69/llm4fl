The exception indicates that the continued fraction diverged to NaN, which suggests that there may be an issue with how this method handles certain inputs.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta:regularizedBeta(DDD)D`**: This method is part of the call chain leading to the exception. It is responsible for calculating the regularized beta function, which is likely involved in the calculations that lead to the divergence.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistribution:cumulativeProbability(I)D`**: This method is also part of the call chain and is responsible for calculating the cumulative probability for the binomial distribution. If it returns an unexpected value, it could propagate errors to the methods that depend on it.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.AbstractIntegerDistribution:inverseCumulativeProbability(D)I`**: This method is responsible for solving the inverse cumulative probability, which is a critical part of the binomial distribution calculations. If it does not handle edge cases correctly, it could lead to the issues observed.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta:regularizedBeta(DDDDI)D`**: This overloaded version of the regularized beta function is also part of the call chain and may have similar issues as the previous regularized beta method.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 10, 7, 15, 11]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
