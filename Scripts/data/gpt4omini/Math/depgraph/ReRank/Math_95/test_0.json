    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here is the re-ranking of the methods along with potential fixes:\n\n1. **Method 1** (`inverseCumulativeProbability`):\n   - **Reasoning**: This method checks if the probability `p` is within the valid range (0.0 to 1.0). If `p` is invalid, it attempts to bracket the function, which can lead to an `IllegalArgumentException` if the bounds are not set correctly. The stack trace indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` related to invalid endpoint parameters, suggesting this method is directly involved in the error.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the bounds are set correctly before calling the `bracket` method. Add validation to check if `lowerBound` and `upperBound` are valid before proceeding with the bracketing.\n\n2. **Method 5** (`bracket`):\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is responsible for bracketing a function and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the initial value or bounds are invalid. Given that the stack trace shows an `IllegalArgumentException`, this method could also be a source of the problem, especially if it is called by the first method.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add checks to ensure that `initial`, `lowerBound`, and `upperBound` are valid before proceeding with the bracketing logic. This will prevent the method from throwing an exception due to invalid parameters.\n\n3. **Method 3** (`getInitialDomain`):\n   - **Reasoning**: This method calculates the initial domain based on the degrees of freedom. While it does not directly handle the probability `p`, if the degrees of freedom are not set correctly, it could lead to issues in the methods that rely on it. However, it is less directly related to the exception than methods 1 and 5.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the degrees of freedom are valid and handle cases where they might lead to invalid calculations. Add validation to check if `d` is greater than 2.0 before performing the division.\n\n4. **Method 2** (`inverseCumulativeProbability` for specific cases):\n   - **Reasoning**: This method handles specific cases for the probability `p` being 0 or 1. It does not seem to contribute to the `IllegalArgumentException` directly, as it only returns a value for these specific cases. Therefore, it is the least suspicious of the methods analyzed.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes are necessary as this method is not contributing to the issue.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
