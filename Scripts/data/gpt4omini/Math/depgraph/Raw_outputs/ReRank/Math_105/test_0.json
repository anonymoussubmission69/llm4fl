"Based on the analysis of the test and the method bodies, here are the findings:\n\n1. **getSumSquaredErrors**:\n   - This method calculates the sum of squared errors using the formula `sumYY - sumXY * sumXY / sumXX`.\n   - If `sumXX` is zero, it will lead to a division by zero error, which is critical since the test checks if the result is non-negative. This makes it highly suspicious.\n\n2. **addData**:\n   - This method adds data points to the regression model and updates the sums used in the calculation of the sum of squared errors.\n   - While it does affect the values used in `getSumSquaredErrors`, it does not directly return a value that is being asserted in the test. Therefore, it is less suspicious compared to `getSumSquaredErrors`.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- For `getSumSquaredErrors`, we can add a check to ensure that `sumXX` is not zero before performing the division. If it is zero, we can return a default value (e.g., 0.0) or throw an exception.\n\n- The `addData` method seems to be functioning correctly, but we should ensure that it properly initializes the sums and counts to avoid any unintended behavior.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\nGiven the analysis, the ranking remains the same as the original since `getSumSquaredErrors` is still the most suspicious due to the potential division by zero.\n\nHere is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
