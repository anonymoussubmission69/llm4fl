"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the exception `TooManyEvaluationsException` indicates that the evaluation count exceeded the maximum allowed. The methods involved in managing the evaluation count and computing objective values are critical in this context.\n\n### Method Analysis and Potential Fixes\n\n1. **Method ID 24: `incrementEvaluationCount`**\n   - **Current Body**: Increments the evaluation count and throws an exception if the maximum count is exceeded.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the increment operation is correctly synchronized and that the maximum count is set appropriately before calling this method.\n   - **ReRank**: 1 (remains the most suspicious)\n\n2. **Method ID 23: `computeObjectiveValue`**\n   - **Current Body**: Calls `incrementEvaluationCount()` and returns the function value.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add a check before calling `incrementEvaluationCount()` to ensure that the count will not exceed the maximum. This could prevent the exception from being thrown.\n   - **ReRank**: 2 (remains the second most suspicious)\n\n3. **Method ID 1: `solve`**\n   - **Current Body**: Calls another `solve` method with parameters including `maxEval`.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that `maxEval` is correctly passed and validated before invoking the solving process. Consider adding logging to track the value of `maxEval`.\n   - **ReRank**: 3 (remains the third most suspicious)\n\n4. **Method ID 0: `doSolve`**\n   - **Current Body**: Contains the main solving logic and calls `computeObjectiveValue`.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Review the logic to ensure that it does not lead to excessive calls to `computeObjectiveValue`. Implement checks to prevent unnecessary evaluations.\n   - **ReRank**: 4 (remains the fourth most suspicious)\n\n5. **Method ID 26: `setup`**\n   - **Current Body**: Sets up the solver with function and evaluation limits.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Validate the parameters being set, especially `maxEval`, to ensure they are within acceptable limits before proceeding.\n   - **ReRank**: 5 (remains the fifth most suspicious)\n\n6. **Method ID 25: `setup`**\n   - **Current Body**: Checks the function and sets search parameters.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the function being passed is valid and that the search parameters do not lead to excessive evaluations.\n   - **ReRank**: 6 (remains the sixth most suspicious)\n\n7. **Method ID 29: `incrementCount`**\n   - **Current Body**: Increments the count and throws an exception if the maximum count is exceeded.\n   - **Potential Fix**: This method is straightforward; however, ensure that it is called in a controlled manner to avoid exceeding the count.\n   - **ReRank**: 7 (remains the least suspicious)\n\n### Final Ranking and Output\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
