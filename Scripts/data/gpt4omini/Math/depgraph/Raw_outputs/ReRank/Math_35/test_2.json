"Based on the analysis of the test case and the stack trace, the test `testConstructorTooLow` is failing because the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor does not validate the `elitismRate` parameter, allowing negative values which should throw an `OutOfRangeException`. The `ListPopulation` constructor, on the other hand, does have validation for the `populationLimit`, making it less suspicious in relation to the test case.\n\n### Method Analysis:\n1. **ElitisticListPopulation (method_id: 0)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 1\n   - **Reasoning**: The constructor does not validate the `elitismRate` parameter, which can lead to negative values being accepted, causing the test to fail.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add validation to check if `elitismRate` is within a valid range (e.g., between 0 and 1). If it is not, throw an `OutOfRangeException`.\n\n   ```java\n   public ElitisticListPopulation(final int populationLimit, final double elitismRate) {\n       super(populationLimit);\n       if (elitismRate < 0 || elitismRate > 1) {\n           throw new OutOfRangeException(elitismRate, 0, 1);\n       }\n       this.elitismRate = elitismRate;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **ListPopulation (method_id: 1)**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 2\n   - **Reasoning**: This constructor has validation for `populationLimit`, making it less suspicious in relation to the test case.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes are necessary as it already validates the input.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\nAfter analyzing the methods, the ranking remains the same since `ElitisticListPopulation` is still the most suspicious due to the lack of validation.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
