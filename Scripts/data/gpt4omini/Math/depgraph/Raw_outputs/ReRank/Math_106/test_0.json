"Based on the analysis of the test case and the stack trace, it appears that the test is failing due to improper handling of a minus sign in the fraction parsing logic. The test specifically checks for the case of an invalid minus sign in the input string \"2 -2 / 3\". \n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n1. **Method ID 0**: This method attempts to parse a fraction but does not handle the case of an invalid minus sign correctly. It is likely the primary source of the issue.\n2. **Method ID 2**: This method has a fallback mechanism but does not explicitly handle the case of a minus sign, which could lead to incorrect parsing.\n3. **Method ID 1**: This method parses the next character but does not seem to handle a minus sign correctly, which could lead to issues in parsing fractions.\n4. **Method ID 3**: This method checks if parsing was successful but does not provide specific handling for invalid inputs like a minus sign.\n5. **Method ID 9**: This method is responsible for parsing and ignoring whitespace, which is essential but does not directly deal with the fraction parsing logic.\n6. **Method ID 6**: This method simply returns the numerator format and is less likely to be the source of the problem since it does not involve parsing logic.\n\n### Proposed Fixes:\n- **Method ID 0**: Add explicit handling for invalid minus signs before parsing the fraction.\n- **Method ID 2**: Ensure that the method checks for a minus sign and handles it appropriately.\n- **Method ID 1**: Modify the method to check for a minus sign and return an error or handle it correctly.\n- **Method ID 3**: Implement checks for invalid inputs, including minus signs, and throw a `ParseException` if encountered.\n- **Method ID 9**: No changes needed as it deals with whitespace.\n- **Method ID 6**: No changes needed as it does not involve parsing logic.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 0**: Most suspicious due to direct parsing logic without handling invalid minus signs.\n2. **Method ID 2**: Second most suspicious for lack of explicit handling of minus signs.\n3. **Method ID 1**: Third for not handling minus signs correctly.\n4. **Method ID 3**: Fourth for not checking for invalid inputs.\n5. **Method ID 9**: Fifth, as it deals with whitespace.\n6. **Method ID 6**: Least suspicious, as it does not involve parsing logic.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
