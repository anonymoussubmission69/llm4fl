"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 1: `chiSquare`**\n   - **Current Rank**: 1\n   - **Reasoning**: This method calls `chiSquareTest` to compute the chi-square statistic. If `chiSquareTest` has issues, it will directly affect this method's output.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the `chiSquareTest` method is correctly implemented and returns the expected value. Check for any logical errors in the calculation.\n\n2. **Method ID 0: `chiSquareTest`**\n   - **Current Rank**: 2\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is responsible for calculating the chi-square test statistic. Since the test fails on the chi-square statistic, this method is highly suspicious.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Review the implementation of the `chiSquareTest` method to ensure it correctly computes the chi-square statistic. Verify that the input arrays are being processed correctly.\n\n3. **Method ID 3: `chiSquareTest` (p-value calculation)**\n   - **Current Rank**: 3\n   - **Reasoning**: This method calculates the p-value based on the chi-square statistic. While it is not directly related to the failing assertion, any issues here could indicate broader problems.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Check the logic for setting degrees of freedom and the cumulative probability calculation. Ensure that the distribution object is correctly initialized and used.\n\n4. **Method ID 2: `chiSquare` (statistic calculation)**\n   - **Current Rank**: 4\n   - **Reasoning**: This method computes the chi-square statistic but has checks for input validity. If inputs are valid, it performs the calculation.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the input validation checks are functioning correctly. If inputs are valid, confirm that the calculation logic is correct.\n\n5. **Method ID 4: `isPositive`**\n   - **Current Rank**: 5\n   - **Reasoning**: This method checks if all elements in the input array are positive. It does not directly affect the computation of the chi-square statistic or p-value.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Correct the logic to return false if any element is non-positive, as the current implementation seems to return true incorrectly.\n\n6. **Method ID 5: `isNonNegative`**\n   - **Current Rank**: 6\n   - **Reasoning**: Similar to method 4, it checks for non-negative values but does not directly impact the failing test.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Correct the logic to return false if any element is negative, as the current implementation seems to return true incorrectly.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods\nAfter analyzing the methods, the ranking remains the same as the initial suspicion, but the potential fixes have been clarified.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
