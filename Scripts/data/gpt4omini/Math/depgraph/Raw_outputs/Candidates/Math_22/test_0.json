"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion error indicating that the expected value was `false`, but the actual value was `true`. This suggests that there is a logical error in the method being tested, specifically in the `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()` method of the `FDistribution` class, which is expected to return `false` but is returning `true`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `FDistribution` class and some utility methods from the `FastMath` and `Gamma` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`** - This method is directly related to the test failure, as it is expected to return `false` but is returning `true`.\n2. **`density(double x)`** - This method may be involved in the calculations that lead to the support lower bound being inclusive.\n3. **`getSupportLowerBound()`** - This method returns the lower bound, which could affect the logic in `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`.\n4. **Constructor methods of `FDistribution`** - These methods initialize the state of the `FDistribution` object, and any issues in the initialization could lead to incorrect behavior in the methods that rely on this state.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 1**: `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`\n- **Method ID 0**: `density(double x)`\n- **Method ID 2**: `getSupportLowerBound()`\n- **Method IDs 3, 4, 5**: Constructors of `FDistribution` which may affect the state of the object. \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
