"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` is designed to validate the chi-square test statistic and p-value calculations using expected and observed values.\n2. The test fails because the expected chi-square test statistic does not match the actual computed value, indicating a potential issue in the methods responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic or the p-value.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to this test and may contain faults are:\n\n1. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic based on the expected and observed values. Any issues in the calculation logic here could directly affect the test outcome.\n2. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for calculating the p-value based on the chi-square statistic. If the statistic is incorrect, the p-value will also be incorrect.\n3. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if all expected values are positive. If it incorrectly identifies the values, it could lead to incorrect calculations.\n4. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - This method checks if all observed values are non-negative. Similar to `isPositive`, any issues here could affect the calculations.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
