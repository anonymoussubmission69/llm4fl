"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` is failing due to an assertion error related to the chi-square test statistic. The expected value is `114875.90421929007`, but the actual value returned is `3624883.3429077636`. This indicates that there is likely a fault in the methods responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is directly responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic. The discrepancy in the expected and actual values suggests that there may be an issue in this method's implementation.\n\n2. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for performing the chi-square test and may also contribute to the incorrect statistic being calculated.\n\n3. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if all values in the expected array are positive. If it incorrectly returns true when there are non-positive values, it could lead to incorrect calculations.\n\n4. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - Similar to `isPositive`, this method checks if all observed values are non-negative. An incorrect return value could also affect the calculations.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, the methods that perform the calculations (`chiSquare` and `chiSquareTest`) are the most critical to analyze, but the validation methods (`isPositive` and `isNonNegative`) should also be checked to ensure they are functioning correctly.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n```"
