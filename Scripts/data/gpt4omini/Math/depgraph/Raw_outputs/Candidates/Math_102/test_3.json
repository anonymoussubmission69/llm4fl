"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChiSquare` is failing due to an assertion error in the chi-square test statistic. The expected value was `9.023307936427388`, but the actual value returned was `16.413107036160778`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the chi-square statistic or the parameters being passed to it.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potential candidates for further investigation:\n\n1. **`TestUtils.chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is directly involved in calculating the chi-square statistic.\n2. **`TestUtils.chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is also involved in the chi-square test and may call the `chiSquare` method.\n3. **`ChiSquareTestImpl.chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method performs the actual computation of the chi-square statistic.\n4. **`ChiSquareTestImpl.isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if the expected values are positive, which is a prerequisite for the chi-square calculation.\n5. **`ChiSquareTestImpl.isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - This method checks if the observed values are non-negative, which is also a prerequisite for the chi-square calculation.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is crucial to analyze the methods that are directly involved in the calculation of the chi-square statistic and those that validate the input parameters.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n}\n```"
