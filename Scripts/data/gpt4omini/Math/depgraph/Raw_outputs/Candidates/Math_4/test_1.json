"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIntersectionNotIntersecting` is designed to check if two `SubLine` objects do not intersect. The test fails with a `NullPointerException`, which indicates that there is an attempt to access a method or property of a null object.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the exception occurs in the `getAbscissa` method of the `Line` class, which is called by the `toSubSpace` method, and subsequently by the `intersection` method of the `SubLine` class.\n\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace are:\n   - `getAbscissa(Line.java:114)`\n   - `toSubSpace(Line.java:129)`\n   - `intersection(SubLine.java:116)`\n\n4. The `intersection` method of `SubLine` is directly called in the test, and it is responsible for determining the intersection point between two `SubLine` objects.\n\n5. The `closestPoint` method in the `Line` class is also relevant as it is called within the `intersection` method of `Line`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be examined further:\n\n- `intersection(SubLine subLine, boolean includeEndPoints)` - This method is directly involved in the test and is where the intersection logic is implemented.\n- `getAbscissa(Vector3D point)` - This method is causing the `NullPointerException`, indicating that it may be trying to access a property of a null object.\n- `toSubSpace(Vector<Euclidean3D> point)` - This method is also involved in the stack trace and may be contributing to the null reference.\n- `closestPoint(Line line)` - This method is indirectly involved and may affect the outcome of the intersection logic.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 8, 7, 2]\n}\n```"
