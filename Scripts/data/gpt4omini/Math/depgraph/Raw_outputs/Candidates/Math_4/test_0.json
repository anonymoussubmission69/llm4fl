"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIntersectionParallel` is designed to check the intersection of two `SubLine` objects. The test expects the intersection to return `null` for both cases (with and without including endpoints).\n2. The stack trace indicates a `NullPointerException` occurring in the `toSubSpace` method of the `Line` class, which is called from the `intersection` method of the `SubLine` class.\n3. The `intersection` method of `SubLine` is directly involved in the test and is likely where the fault originates.\n4. The `toSubSpace` method of `Line` is also suspicious as it is where the exception is thrown, indicating that it may be trying to operate on a null object.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- `SubLine.intersection`\n- `Line.toSubSpace`\n\nAdditionally, the following methods are also relevant as they are part of the call chain and may contribute to the fault:\n- `Line.intersection`\n- `SubLine.getRemainingRegion`\n- `SubLine.getHyperplane`\n\nBased on this analysis, the suspicious methods are ranked as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 1, 20, 23]\n}\n``` \n\n- `0` corresponds to `SubLine.intersection`\n- `3` corresponds to `Line.toSubSpace`\n- `1` corresponds to `Line.intersection`\n- `20` corresponds to `SubLine.getRemainingRegion`\n- `23` corresponds to `AbstractSubHyperplane.getHyperplane` (which is called in `SubLine.intersection`) \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the `NullPointerException`."
