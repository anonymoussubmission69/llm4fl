"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath679` is failing because it expects an exception `NumberIsTooLargeException` to be thrown when creating an instance of `OpenMapRealMatrix` with parameters `(3, Integer.MAX_VALUE)`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs during the evaluation of the test, specifically when the constructor of `OpenMapRealMatrix` is called.\n\nThe constructor of `OpenMapRealMatrix` calls its superclass constructor and initializes its fields. The failure likely stems from the handling of the `columnDimension` parameter, which is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This could lead to issues in the initialization of the internal data structures, particularly in the `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap` class, which is used to store matrix entries.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `OpenMapRealMatrix` constructor\n2. `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap` constructors\n3. `computeCapacity` method in `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap`\n4. `AbstractRealMatrix` constructor\n5. `FastMath` utility methods\n\nGiven the context, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **OpenMapRealMatrix:<init>(II)** - This is the constructor being directly tested and is likely where the fault originates.\n2. **OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:<init>(D)** - This constructor is called within the `OpenMapRealMatrix` constructor and may not handle the large size correctly.\n3. **OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:<init>(ID)** - This constructor is also called and may be related to the capacity calculations.\n4. **OpenIntToDoubleHashMap:computeCapacity(I)** - This method is crucial for determining the capacity of the internal storage and may not handle large values properly.\n5. **AbstractRealMatrix:<init>(II)** - This constructor is a superclass constructor that may have constraints on the dimensions.\n6. **FastMath:ceil(D)** and **FastMath:floor(D)** - These methods are utility methods that may be involved in calculations related to the dimensions.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
