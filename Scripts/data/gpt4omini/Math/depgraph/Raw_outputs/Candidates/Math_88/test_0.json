"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMath272` is designed to optimize a linear objective function using the `SimplexSolver`. The test fails at the assertion that checks the expected values of the solution.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the expected value of one of the solution components is `1.0`, but the actual value returned is `0.0`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue in the optimization process, particularly in how the solution is derived from the tableau.\n3. The methods involved in the optimization process, particularly those related to creating the tableau and retrieving the solution, are critical to investigate.\n\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and warrant further analysis:\n\n1. **createTableau**: This method constructs the tableau used in the optimization process. Any issues in how the tableau is created could lead to incorrect solutions.\n2. **getSolution**: This method retrieves the solution from the tableau. If the solution is not computed correctly, it would directly affect the test outcome.\n3. **getBasicRow**: This method is used to find the basic row in the tableau, which is essential for determining the solution.\n4. **discardArtificialVariables**: This method is responsible for handling artificial variables in the tableau, which can affect the final solution.\n5. **normalize**: This method normalizes constraints, which is crucial for ensuring that the constraints are correctly represented in the tableau.\n6. **getNormalizedConstraints**: This method retrieves the normalized constraints, which are used to create the tableau.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
