"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNotPositiveDefinite` is designed to check if a `CholeskyDecomposition` implementation correctly throws a `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` when provided with a non-positive definite matrix. The stack trace indicates that the expected exception was not thrown, which suggests that there may be an issue in the methods responsible for checking the matrix properties or performing the decomposition.\n\nThe following methods are identified as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation:\n\n1. **CholeskyDecompositionImpl.<init>(RealMatrix)** - This constructor initializes the decomposition and may not be correctly handling the case for non-positive definite matrices.\n2. **CholeskyDecompositionImpl.getL()** - This method retrieves the lower triangular matrix and may not be correctly implemented if the decomposition was not successful.\n3. **CholeskyDecompositionImpl.getLT()** - Similar to `getL()`, this method retrieves the transpose of the lower triangular matrix and may also be affected by the decomposition logic.\n4. **AbstractRealMatrix.isSquare()** - This method checks if the matrix is square, which is a prerequisite for Cholesky decomposition. If it incorrectly identifies a non-square matrix, it could lead to issues.\n5. **MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix(double[][])** - This utility method creates a real matrix and may not be handling the input correctly, affecting the subsequent decomposition.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as the constructor initializes the decomposition and relies on the properties of the matrix being square and positive definite. If any of these methods fail to perform their checks or calculations correctly, it could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 9, 4]\n}\n```"
