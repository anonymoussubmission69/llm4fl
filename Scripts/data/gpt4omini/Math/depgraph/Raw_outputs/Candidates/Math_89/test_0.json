"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testAddNonComparable` is designed to check the behavior of the `addValue` method in the `Frequency` class when a non-comparable object is added. The expectation is that an `IllegalArgumentException` should be thrown, but instead, a `ClassCastException` is thrown, indicating that the method is attempting to cast an `Object` to a `Comparable`.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurs in the `addValue` method of the `Frequency` class, specifically at the line where it tries to cast the object to `Comparable`.\n\n3. The `Frequency` constructor initializes a `TreeMap`, which is not directly related to the failure but is part of the class's state.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n- `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency:addValue(Ljava/lang/Object;)V` (method_id: 0): This method is directly responsible for the failure as it attempts to cast the input object to `Comparable`, leading to the `ClassCastException`.\n\n- `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency:<init>()V` (method_id: 1): While this method initializes the `Frequency` object, it is less likely to be the source of the fault but is included for completeness.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
