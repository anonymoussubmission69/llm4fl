"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChromosomeListConstructorTooHigh` is designed to check if an exception is thrown when an invalid elitism rate (1.25) is provided to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The expected exception is `OutOfRangeException`, which indicates that the elitism rate must be within a certain range (likely between 0 and 1).\n\nThe stack trace shows that the test fails because the expected exception is not thrown, suggesting that there may be an issue in the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` or its superclass `ListPopulation`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor\n2. `ListPopulation` constructor\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`ElitisticListPopulation` constructor**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for setting the elitism rate. If it does not validate the elitism rate correctly, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n2. **`ListPopulation` constructor**: This method is called by the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. If it does not handle the population limit or the chromosomes list correctly, it could also contribute to the failure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to determine if they correctly handle the input parameters and throw the expected exceptions.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
