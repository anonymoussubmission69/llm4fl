"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChromosomeListConstructorTooLow` is expected to throw an `OutOfRangeException` when an invalid elitism rate (negative value) is provided to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The stack trace indicates that the exception was not thrown as expected, which suggests that there may be an issue in the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` or its superclass `ListPopulation`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor\n2. `ListPopulation` constructor\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`ElitisticListPopulation` constructor**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for initializing the elitism rate. If it does not properly validate the elitism rate, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n2. **`ListPopulation` constructor**: This method is called within the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. If it does not handle the population limit correctly or if it allows invalid states to propagate, it could also be a source of the issue.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are critical to the test's failure, as they are involved in the construction of the `ElitisticListPopulation` object. The constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` should validate the elitism rate, and the constructor of `ListPopulation` should ensure that the population limit is handled correctly.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
