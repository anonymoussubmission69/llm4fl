"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIntegerOverflow` is designed to check for integer overflow conditions when creating a `Fraction` object. The test fails because an exception was expected to be thrown, but it was not.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `checkIntegerOverflow` method, which is likely responsible for validating the integer overflow conditions. The methods that are covered by the failed test include constructors of the `Fraction` class and the `FractionConversionException` class, which are critical in handling the overflow logic.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Fraction Constructor with Four Parameters** (`Fraction:<init>(DDII)V`): This method contains the logic for checking if the value exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which is directly related to the overflow condition being tested.\n\n2. **Fraction Constructor with Three Parameters** (`Fraction:<init>(DDI)V`): This constructor calls the four-parameter constructor, so it is also relevant to the overflow logic.\n\n3. **FractionConversionException Constructor** (`FractionConversionException:<init>(DJJ)V`): This method is invoked when an overflow condition is detected, so it is important to ensure that it is being triggered correctly.\n\n4. **FastMath.floor**: This method is used to calculate the floor of a double value, which is part of the overflow logic. If it does not handle edge cases correctly, it could lead to incorrect behavior.\n\n5. **FastMath.abs**: This method is used to get the absolute value of a double, which is also part of the calculations in the overflow logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 10, 11]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test case."
