"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath286` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected value is `6.9`, but the actual value returned is `4.6000000000000005`. This indicates that there is a discrepancy in the optimization process, likely within the methods involved in the optimization logic.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `SimplexTableau` and `SimplexSolver` classes, which are critical for the optimization process. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **createTableau**: This method is responsible for creating the tableau used in the Simplex algorithm. If there is an error in how the tableau is constructed, it could lead to incorrect optimization results.\n2. **getSolution**: This method retrieves the solution from the tableau. If the tableau is incorrect, the solution will also be incorrect.\n3. **doOptimize**: This method orchestrates the optimization process. If there are issues in the iterations or the way the tableau is manipulated, it could lead to incorrect results.\n4. **solvePhase1**: This method is part of the optimization process and is crucial for handling artificial variables. Errors here could affect the overall optimization.\n5. **isOptimal**: This method checks if the current solution is optimal. If it incorrectly determines optimality, it could lead to premature termination of the optimization process.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 36, 40, 32]\n}\n```"
