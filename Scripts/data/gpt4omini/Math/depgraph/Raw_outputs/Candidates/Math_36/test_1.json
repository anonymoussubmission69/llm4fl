"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDoubleValueForLargeNumeratorAndDenominator` is failing because it expected a double value of `5.0` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the double value in the `doubleValue()` method of the `BigFraction` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **`doubleValue()`**: This method performs the division of the numerator by the denominator. If the denominator is zero or if the result of the division is not a valid double (e.g., resulting in NaN), this method will fail.\n   \n2. **`BigFraction(BigInteger num, BigInteger den)`**: This constructor checks for null values and handles the case where the denominator is zero. If the denominator is zero, it could lead to an invalid state for the `BigFraction` object.\n\n3. **`MathUtils.checkNotNull(Object o, Localizable... args)`**: This utility method checks if an object is null. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure, it is still relevant as it ensures that the numerator and denominator are not null.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be further examined are:\n\n- `doubleValue()`\n- `BigFraction(BigInteger num, BigInteger den)`\n\nThe `checkNotNull` method is also included for completeness, but it is less likely to be the source of the issue.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
