"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **RectangularCholeskyDecomposition constructor** (`RectangularCholeskyDecomposition:<init>`): This method initializes the decomposition and is critical as it sets up the internal state of the object. Any issues here could lead to incorrect results later.\n\n2. **getRootMatrix** (`RectangularCholeskyDecomposition:getRootMatrix`): This method retrieves the root matrix, which is essential for the subsequent calculations in the test. If the root matrix is not computed correctly, it will affect the assertions.\n\n3. **multiply** (`AbstractRealMatrix:multiply`): This method is used to multiply matrices. If there is an issue with matrix multiplication, it could lead to incorrect results in the test.\n\n4. **subtract** (`AbstractRealMatrix:subtract`): This method is used to subtract matrices. Similar to multiplication, any issues here could lead to incorrect results in the assertions.\n\n5. **getNorm** (`AbstractRealMatrix:getNorm`): This method calculates the norm of a matrix, which is used in the assertions to check for equality. If the norm is calculated incorrectly, it will lead to assertion failures.\n\n6. **createRealMatrix** (`MatrixUtils:createRealMatrix`): This method is used to create a matrix from a 2D array. If the matrix is not created correctly, it will affect all subsequent operations.\n\n7. **checkMultiplicationCompatible** (`MatrixUtils:checkMultiplicationCompatible`): This method checks if two matrices can be multiplied. If this check fails or is incorrect, it could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.\n\n8. **checkSubtractionCompatible** (`MatrixUtils:checkSubtractionCompatible`): Similar to multiplication, this method checks if two matrices can be subtracted. Issues here could also lead to incorrect results.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 11, 18, 7, 2, 12, 22]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
