"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIssue631` is failing due to an unexpected exception: `TooManyEvaluationsException`, which indicates that the maximum number of evaluations allowed was exceeded during the execution of the solver. The test expected a `ConvergenceException` instead.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:incrementEvaluationCount()`** - This method is responsible for incrementing the evaluation count and throwing a `TooManyEvaluationsException` if the count exceeds the maximum allowed. This is a direct cause of the failure.\n\n2. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:computeObjectiveValue(double)`** - This method calls `incrementEvaluationCount()`, which is crucial in determining if the maximum evaluation count is reached.\n\n3. **`BaseSecantSolver:doSolve()`** - This method is part of the solving process and is where the evaluations are performed. If it is not correctly managing the evaluations, it could lead to exceeding the maximum count.\n\n4. **`BaseSecantSolver:solve(int, UnivariateRealFunction, double, double)`** - This method initiates the solving process and could be involved in how the evaluations are set up.\n\n5. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:setup(int, UnivariateRealFunction, double, double, double)`** - This method sets up the solver, including the maximum evaluation count. If the setup is incorrect, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n\n6. **`Incrementor:incrementCount()`** - This method is responsible for checking if the count exceeds the maximum and throwing the `MaxCountExceededException`, which is caught and rethrown as `TooManyEvaluationsException`.\n\n7. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:solve(int, UnivariateRealFunction, double, double)`** - This method is also involved in the solving process and could be relevant to the evaluation count.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [24, 23, 0, 1, 25, 29, 26]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to understand why the maximum evaluation count is being exceeded and to ensure that the solver behaves as expected."
