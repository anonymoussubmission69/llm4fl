"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath835` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected value does not match the actual value returned by the `percentageValue()` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is specifically designed to check for overflow issues, which suggests that the methods involved in the calculation of the percentage might be problematic.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are therefore suspicious:\n\n1. **`percentageValue()`**: This method is directly involved in the calculation that is being tested. It multiplies the fraction by 100 and returns the result as a double. If there is an overflow in the multiplication, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **`multiply(int i)`**: This method is called by `percentageValue()` to perform the multiplication. If the multiplication of the numerator by 100 leads to an overflow, this method could be the source of the problem.\n\n3. **`doubleValue()`**: This method converts the fraction to a double. If the numerator or denominator is not handled correctly, it could lead to incorrect double values, especially if there are issues with integer overflow.\n\n4. **`<init>(int num, int den)`**: The constructor initializes the fraction. If the denominator is zero or if there are issues with how the numerator and denominator are set, it could lead to incorrect fraction values.\n\n5. **`gcd(int p, int q)`**: This method is used in the constructor to calculate the greatest common divisor. If there are issues with the inputs to this method, it could affect the initialization of the fraction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n```"
