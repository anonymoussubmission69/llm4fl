"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBasicFunctions` is failing due to an assertion error related to the expected and actual values of the L-infinity norm. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred at line 1098 in the test class, specifically when comparing the expected value of `6.0` with the actual value of `128.0`.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **getL1Norm()**: This method calculates the L1 norm of the vector. The implementation seems to have a return statement inside the loop, which would cause it to return prematurely after the first iteration. This could lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **getLInfNorm()**: Similar to `getL1Norm`, this method also has a return statement inside the loop, which would cause it to return prematurely. This could also lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **getNorm()**: This method calculates the Euclidean norm (L2 norm) of the vector. It also has a return statement inside the loop, which could lead to incorrect results.\n\n4. **ArrayRealVector constructor**: While this method is responsible for initializing the vector, it is less likely to be the source of the fault since it simply clones the input array.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the methods that need to be further investigated are `getL1Norm`, `getLInfNorm`, and `getNorm` due to their potential to return incorrect values because of the premature return statements.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
