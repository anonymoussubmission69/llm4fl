"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDivideZero` is designed to check the behavior of the `divide` method in the `Complex` class when dividing by zero. The expected result is `Complex.INF`, but the actual result is `Complex.NaN`, leading to a test failure.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed for potential faults are:\n\n1. **`Complex.toString()`**: This method is responsible for converting the complex number to a string representation. While it may not directly cause the fault, it could be involved in the output representation of the result.\n\n2. **`Complex.equals(Object other)`**: This method checks for equality between complex numbers. If the `divide` method returns `NaN`, this method's behavior could be relevant when comparing the result.\n\n3. **`MathUtils.checkNotNull(Object o)`**: This method checks for null values. While it may not directly relate to the division operation, it is good to ensure that no null values are being passed around.\n\n4. **`Complex.<init>(double real, double imaginary)`**: The constructor initializes the complex number and checks if the values are NaN or infinite. This is crucial because if the division operation leads to a NaN result, it may be due to how the constructor handles these values.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n```"
