"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testArrayEquals` is designed to test the `equals` method of the `MathUtils` class, specifically for arrays of doubles. The test fails when comparing two arrays that are expected to be equal but are not, which indicates a potential issue in the `equals` method.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the assertion that checks if two arrays are equal. The relevant method being tested is `MathUtils.equals(double[] x, double[] y)`.\n\n3. The `equals` method for double arrays checks for null values and compares lengths before iterating through the elements. If the lengths are not equal, it returns false. If the elements are not equal, it calls another `equals` method that compares individual double values.\n\n4. The second method `MathUtils.equals(double x, double y)` is also relevant as it handles the comparison of individual double values, including the special case for NaN.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be examined further are:\n\n- `MathUtils.equals(double[] x, double[] y)` (method_id: 0)\n- `MathUtils.equals(double x, double y)` (method_id: 1)\n\nThese methods are likely to contain the fault that is causing the test to fail.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
