"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMean()` is designed to check the behavior of the `PoissonDistributionImpl` class when initialized with a negative mean. The expectation is that it should throw a `NotStrictlyPositiveException`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception is thrown from the constructor of `PoissonDistributionImpl`, specifically when the mean is checked for positivity.\n3. The constructor of `PoissonDistributionImpl` that is invoked takes a double parameter and calls another constructor with default values for epsilon and maxIterations.\n4. The exception is created using the `MathRuntimeException.createIllegalArgumentException` method, which is also relevant to the fault.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 0**: `PoissonDistributionImpl.<init>(DDI)V` - This constructor directly checks if the mean is positive and throws an exception if it is not.\n- **Method ID 1**: `PoissonDistributionImpl.<init>(D)V` - This constructor calls the first constructor and is involved in the initialization process.\n- **Method ID 7**: `MathRuntimeException.createIllegalArgumentException(...)` - This method is responsible for creating the exception that is thrown when the mean is not positive.\n\nThese methods are directly related to the failure observed in the test, as they are involved in the initialization of the `PoissonDistributionImpl` object and the exception handling.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 7]\n}\n```"
