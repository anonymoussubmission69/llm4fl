"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion error where the expected value was `2.213363839400643`, but the actual value was `NaN`. This indicates that somewhere in the computation, a value was not properly calculated, leading to a `NaN` result.\n\nThe stack trace points to the method `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` in the `SummaryStatisticsTest` class, which suggests that the issue may be related to the geometric mean calculation. The covered methods include several that are involved in statistical calculations, particularly the geometric mean.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **GeometricMean:evaluate** - This method is directly involved in calculating the geometric mean and could be the source of the `NaN` result.\n2. **FastMath:exp** - This method is used in the geometric mean calculation and could potentially return `NaN` if the input is invalid.\n3. **GeometricMean:getResult** - This method retrieves the result of the geometric mean calculation and checks if the sum of logs is greater than zero, which could lead to a `NaN` if not handled properly.\n4. **SumOfLogs:increment** - This method increments the sum of logs, and if it encounters a non-positive value, it could lead to issues in the geometric mean calculation.\n5. **checkEmpty** - This method checks if the statistics are empty, which could affect the calculations if not handled correctly.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 16, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the `NaN` result in the geometric mean calculation."
