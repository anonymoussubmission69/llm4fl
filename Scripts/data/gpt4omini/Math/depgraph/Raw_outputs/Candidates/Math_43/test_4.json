"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed because it expected a value of `2.5` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with a calculation that is resulting in a Not-a-Number (NaN) value. \n\nThe stack trace points to the `Mean.evaluate` method, which is responsible for calculating the mean of a set of values. The `evaluate` method in the `Mean` class calls the `Sum.evaluate` method, which also has a potential for returning NaN if the input values are not valid.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Mean.evaluate** - This method is directly involved in the calculation that led to the failure.\n2. **Sum.evaluate** - This method is called by the `Mean.evaluate` method and is responsible for summing the values, which could lead to NaN if the input is invalid.\n3. **Sum.increment** - This method is responsible for incrementing the sum and could also contribute to the NaN issue if it is not handling values correctly.\n4. **AbstractUnivariateStatistic.test** - This method is responsible for validating the input values before calculations are performed. If it fails to validate correctly, it could lead to NaN results.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 17, 22]\n}\n``` \n\n- **0**: Mean.evaluate\n- **1**: Sum.evaluate\n- **17**: Sum.increment\n- **22**: AbstractUnivariateStatistic.test\n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the NaN value being returned."
