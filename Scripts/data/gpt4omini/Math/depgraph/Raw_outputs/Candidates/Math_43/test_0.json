"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed because it expected a value of `1.25` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of variance or mean, as these calculations can lead to `NaN` if not handled properly.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to variance and mean calculations. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **Variance:evaluate(double[], double, int, int)** - This method is responsible for calculating the variance and has a return value of `NaN` if the input values are not valid.\n2. **Variance:evaluate(double[], int, int)** - This method calls the previous method and could propagate the `NaN` value if the mean is not calculated correctly.\n3. **Mean:evaluate(double[], int, int)** - This method calculates the mean and could also return `NaN` if the input values are invalid.\n4. **Sum:evaluate(double[], int, int)** - This method is used to calculate the sum of the values, which is a part of the mean calculation.\n5. **Variance:getResult()** - This method returns the result of the variance calculation and could return `NaN` if the internal state is not valid.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate through the others, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 34]\n}\n```"
