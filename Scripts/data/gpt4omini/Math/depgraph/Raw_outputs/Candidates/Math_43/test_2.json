"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideMeanWithMathClass` is failing because it expected a mean value of `2.5` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the mean, which is performed in the `Mean` class's `evaluate` method.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Mean:evaluate** - This method is responsible for calculating the mean. The presence of `NaN` suggests that there might be an issue in how the mean is computed, particularly in the handling of the input values or the calculation logic itself.\n\n2. **Sum:evaluate** - This method is used to calculate the sum of the values, which is a crucial part of the mean calculation. If the sum is incorrect, the mean will also be incorrect.\n\n3. **SummaryStatistics:addValue** - This method adds values to the statistics. If there is an issue with how values are being added or if the state of the statistics is not being updated correctly, it could lead to incorrect mean calculations.\n\n4. **Mean:getResult** - This method retrieves the result of the mean calculation. If the mean has not been calculated correctly, this method will return `NaN`.\n\n5. **AbstractUnivariateStatistic:test** - This method is used to validate the input values before performing calculations. If the input validation fails or does not handle edge cases correctly, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n6. **FirstMoment:increment** and **SecondMoment:increment** - These methods are responsible for updating the first and second moments, which are used in various statistical calculations. If they are not updating correctly, it could affect the mean calculation.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 5, 22, 2, 3]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes methods that are directly involved in the mean calculation and those that could affect the state of the statistics being computed. Each of these methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure."
