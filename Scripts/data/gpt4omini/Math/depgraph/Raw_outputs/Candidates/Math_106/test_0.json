"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` is designed to check the parsing of a string representation of a fraction. The test expects a `ParseException` to be thrown when an invalid input is provided. The stack trace indicates that the test failed because the expected exception was not thrown, leading to an assertion failure.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several parsing methods in the `ProperFractionFormat` and `FractionFormat` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`parse(String source, ParsePosition pos)`** - This method is responsible for parsing the fraction from the string. It is the main method that is likely to contain the logic that failed to handle the invalid input correctly.\n\n2. **`parseNextCharacter(String source, ParsePosition pos)`** - This method is called within the parsing logic to get the next character from the input string. If it does not handle invalid characters properly, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n3. **`getNumeratorFormat().parse(source, pos)`** - This method is called to parse the numerator. If the numerator parsing fails or does not handle invalid input correctly, it could lead to the overall failure of the parsing process.\n\n4. **`getDenominatorFormat().parse(source, pos)`** - Similar to the numerator, if the denominator parsing fails, it could also contribute to the failure of the overall parsing.\n\n5. **`parseAndIgnoreWhitespace(String source, ParsePosition pos)`** - This method is responsible for ignoring whitespace in the input string. If it does not handle whitespace correctly, it could affect the parsing logic.\n\n6. **`parse(String source)`** - This method is a wrapper that calls the main parsing method. If it does not handle the result of the parsing correctly, it could lead to the failure of the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
