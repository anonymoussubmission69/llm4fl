"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is focused on the `lcm` (Least Common Multiple) method from the `MathUtils` class. The test is failing because it expects an `ArithmeticException` when calling `MathUtils.lcm(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 1)`, but it does not receive this exception.\n\n2. The `lcm` method checks for zero values and returns zero if either input is zero. However, it does not handle the case where the inputs are `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which could lead to an overflow when calculating the LCM using the formula `(a * b) / gcd(a, b)`.\n\n3. The `gcd` method is also covered in the test, and it is called within the `lcm` method. If the `gcd` method does not handle negative values or zero correctly, it could lead to incorrect results in the `lcm` calculation.\n\n4. The `mulAndCheck` method is responsible for checking the multiplication of two integers to prevent overflow. If this method does not correctly handle the multiplication of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and another integer, it could also lead to issues in the `lcm` method.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n- `MathUtils.lcm(int a, int b)` - The primary method under test that is failing.\n- `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)` - Called within the `lcm` method and could affect its behavior.\n- `MathUtils.mulAndCheck(int x, int y)` - Responsible for checking multiplication and could be involved in overflow issues.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
