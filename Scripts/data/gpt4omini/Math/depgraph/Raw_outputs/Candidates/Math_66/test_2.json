"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **getOptima()** - This method throws an `IllegalStateException` if no optimum has been computed yet. The test indicates that this method was expected to throw an exception, which suggests that the state of the optimizer may not have been set correctly before calling this method.\n\n2. **getOptimaValues()** - Similar to `getOptima()`, this method also throws an `IllegalStateException` if no optimum values have been computed. The test also expected this method to throw an exception, indicating potential issues with the state of the optimizer.\n\n3. **optimize(UnivariateRealFunction, GoalType, double, double)** - This method is responsible for performing the optimization. The test failure indicates that the result of the optimization was not as expected, which could be due to issues in this method's implementation or the way it interacts with the optimizer's state.\n\n4. **getAbsoluteAccuracy()** and **getRelativeAccuracy()** - These methods are used to retrieve the accuracy settings of the optimizer. If the accuracy settings are not set correctly, it could lead to unexpected results during optimization.\n\n5. **setAbsoluteAccuracy(double)** and **setRelativeAccuracy(double)** - These methods are responsible for setting the accuracy of the optimizer. If they are not called with the correct values, it could affect the optimization process.\n\n6. **BrentOptimizer:optimize(...)** - This method is called within the `optimize` method of `MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer`. If there are issues in the implementation of the Brent optimization algorithm, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n7. **createIllegalStateException(...)** - This method is used to create the `IllegalStateException` that is thrown by the other methods. While it may not directly cause the test failure, understanding its usage could provide insights into the state management of the optimizer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
