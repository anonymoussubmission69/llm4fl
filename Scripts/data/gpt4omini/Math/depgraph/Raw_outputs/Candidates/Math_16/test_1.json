"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath905LargePositive` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, where the expected value is `0.0` but the actual value is `Infinity`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the calculations performed in the methods being tested, particularly those related to hyperbolic functions (`FastMath.cosh` and `FastMath.sinh`).\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **`FastMath.cosh(double x)`** - This method is directly tested in the loop where the error is calculated.\n2. **`FastMath.sinh(double x)`** - This method is also directly tested in the second loop.\n3. **`FastMath.exp(double x)`** - This method is called within the `exp(double x, double extra, double[] hiPrec)` method, which is likely involved in the calculations leading to the hyperbolic functions.\n4. **`FastMath.ulp(double x)`** - This method is used to calculate the unit in the last place, which is involved in the error calculation.\n5. **`FastMath.max(double a, double b)`** - This method is used to determine the maximum error, and any issues here could propagate to the final result.\n\nGiven the context of the error and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 0**: `FastMath.exp(double x, double extra, double[] hiPrec)` - Potentially returns `Infinity` for large inputs.\n- **Method ID 1**: `FastMath.max(double a, double b)` - Used in error calculation.\n- **Method ID 2**: `FastMath.ulp(double x)` - Involved in error calculation.\n- **Method ID 4**: `FastMath.exp(double x)` - Calls the method that could return `Infinity`.\n- **Method ID 5**: `FastMath.abs(double x)` - Used in the error calculation, could affect results if not handled properly. \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure."
