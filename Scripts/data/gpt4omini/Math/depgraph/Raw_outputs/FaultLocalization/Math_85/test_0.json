"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testMath280` is failing due to a `MathException`, specifically a `ConvergenceException`. This indicates that the method responsible for calculating the inverse cumulative probability is not converging within the allowed iterations, which suggests a potential issue in the logic of the methods involved in this calculation.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in the `NormalDistributionImpl` class, which is likely where the failure originates. This method is expected to handle edge cases for the input probability `p`.\n\n3. The methods that are involved in the calculation of the cumulative probability and its inverse are interconnected. Therefore, methods that deal with bounds, bracketing, and domain checks are also suspicious.\n\nNow, I will rank the methods based on their potential to cause the failure:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'inverseCumulativeProbability' method is directly involved in the test that is failing. It handles the input probability 'p' and has conditions that could lead to convergence issues if not properly managed.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'cumulativeProbability' method is likely called during the inverse calculation.
