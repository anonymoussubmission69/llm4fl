The test case is failing due to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, which suggests that the method is trying to access an index that does not exist in the array. The test case uses single-element arrays, and if the method does not handle this case properly, it could lead to accessing an index that is out of bounds, especially in the loop where it accesses prodHigh[1]. This makes it highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
