"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the error `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 6` indicates that there is an attempt to access an index in an array that is out of its bounds. This is likely happening in the `getCovariances` method, which is called during the estimation process. \n\nThe `getCovariances` method calculates a covariance matrix based on the jacobian and the number of parameters and measurements. If the dimensions of the jacobian or the parameters are not correctly set or if there are more parameters than expected, it could lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getCovariances method is directly involved in calculating the covariance matrix and is where the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.

If it does not correctly fill the jacobian based on the measurements and parameters, it could lead to the out-of-bounds error in getCovariances.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getRMS method calculates the root mean square of the residuals.
