"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testMath1021` is failing due to an assertion that checks if the sampled value from the `HypergeometricDistribution` is within the expected range (0 to n). The failure indicates that a sample of -50 was returned, which is outside the valid range.\n\nThe methods involved in the sampling process include calculations for the mean, variance, and support bounds. The suspicious methods are those that directly influence the sampling process or the calculations that lead to the sampled value.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The sample method directly calls inverseCumulativeProbability, which is responsible for generating the sample value. If this method has issues, it will directly affect the output of the sample method.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The inverseCumulativeProbability method is crucial for determining the sampled value. If the logic for calculating the bounds or handling edge cases is flawed, it could lead to invalid sample values.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getNumericalVariance method relies on calculateNumericalVariance, which could affect the variance used in the sampling process. If the variance is incorrectly calculated, it could lead to incorrect sampling results.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The calculateNumericalVariance method is responsible for calculating the variance based on population size and successes. If this calculation is incorrect, it could propagate errors to the sampling process.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getNumericalMean method calculates the mean based on sample size and successes. While it is less directly related to the sampling process, an incorrect mean could still affect the overall distribution.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getSupportUpperBound method determines the upper limit for sampling. If this method returns an incorrect upper bound, it could lead to invalid samples, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getSupportLowerBound method is incomplete in the provided code, but it is responsible for determining the lower limit for sampling. If it returns an incorrect value, it could contribute to invalid samples, but it is the least suspicious due to its incomplete state.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
