"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testCompareTo` is failing due to an assertion that expected a result of `-1` but received `0`. This indicates that the `compareTo` method is not correctly distinguishing between the two `Fraction` objects being compared.\n\n### Method Analysis:\n1. **Method 0: `compareTo(Fraction object)`**\n   - This method compares the double values of two `Fraction` objects. The logic seems straightforward, but if the `doubleValue()` method does not return the expected results, it could lead to incorrect comparisons.\n   - **Suspicion**: High, as it directly relates to the failing test.\n\n2. **Method 1: `Fraction(int num, int den)`**\n   - This constructor initializes a `Fraction` object. It checks for a denominator of zero, but the logic appears incomplete in the provided snippet.\n   - **Suspicion**: Medium, as improper initialization could lead to incorrect values in the `Fraction` objects.\n\n3. **Method 2: `doubleValue()`**\n   - This method converts the fraction to a double. If the numerator or denominator is incorrect, this will lead to incorrect comparisons in `compareTo`.\n   - **Suspicion**: Medium to High, as it directly affects the output of `compareTo`.\n\n4. **Method 3: `gcd(int p, int q)`**\n   - This method calculates the greatest common divisor. While it is important for reducing fractions, it does not directly relate to the comparison logic.\n   - **Suspicion**: Low, as it is not directly involved in the comparison process.\n\n### Ranking of Methods:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The compareTo method is responsible for comparing two Fraction objects.
