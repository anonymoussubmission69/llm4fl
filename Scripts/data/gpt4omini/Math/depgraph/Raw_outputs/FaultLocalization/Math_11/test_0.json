"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testUnivariateDistribution` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected density value does not match the actual density value calculated by the `MultivariateNormalDistribution` and `NormalDistribution`. The methods involved in calculating these densities are crucial to understanding where the discrepancy arises.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method calculates the density for a multivariate normal distribution. It checks the dimension of the input values against the expected dimension. If there's a mismatch, it could lead to incorrect density calculations, which is critical for the test's assertion.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method calculates the density for a univariate normal distribution. It uses the mean and standard deviation, which are essential parameters. If these parameters are incorrect or not aligned with the multivariate distribution, it could lead to the assertion failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method computes the exponent term used in the density calculation. If the covariance matrix or means are incorrect, it could lead to an incorrect exponent term, affecting the final density calculation.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This constructor initializes the multivariate normal distribution and checks the covariance matrix. If the covariance matrix is not set up correctly, it could lead to incorrect density calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method calculates the determinant of the covariance matrix based on the eigenvalues. If the eigenvalues are incorrect, it could affect the density calculations indirectly.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method returns the real eigenvalues. While it is not directly involved in calculations, incorrect eigenvalues could lead to issues in other methods that depend on them.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method returns a solver for the decomposition. It is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure but could contribute to issues if the decomposition is incorrect.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks for complex eigenvalues. While important for the integrity of the covariance matrix, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the assertion failure in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
