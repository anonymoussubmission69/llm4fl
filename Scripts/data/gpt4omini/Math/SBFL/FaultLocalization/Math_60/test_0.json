    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testExtremeValues` is designed to check the behavior of the `cumulativeProbability` method of a `NormalDistribution` implementation when given extreme values. The stack trace indicates that a `ConvergenceException` is thrown due to a continued fraction diverging to NaN for the value of infinity. This suggests that the issue lies within the methods involved in calculating the cumulative probability, particularly those that handle extreme values.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The cumulativeProbability method is directly involved in the test that fails.
