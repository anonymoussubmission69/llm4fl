    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testDivideZero` is failing because it expects the result of dividing a complex number by zero to be `(NaN, NaN)`, but it is returning `(Infinity, Infinity)`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the division logic of the `Complex` class.\n\nNow, let's analyze the method bodies:\n\n1. **Method ID 3 (Constructor)**: This method initializes a `Complex` object and checks if the real or imaginary parts are NaN. However, it seems to be incomplete as it does not handle the case where the values are infinite. This could lead to incorrect behavior when dividing by zero.\n\n2. **Method ID 4 (equals method)**: This method checks for equality between two `Complex` objects. It has a check for `isNaN`, but it does not handle the case for infinity. This could lead to incorrect comparisons when one of the complex numbers is infinite.\n\n3. **Method ID 1 (getReal)**: This method simply returns the real part of the complex number. It does not contribute to the division logic or the failure.\n\n4. **Method ID 2 (getImaginary)**: Similar to `getReal`, this method returns the imaginary part. It does not contribute to the division logic or the failure.\n\n5. **Method ID 0 (toString)**: This method returns a string representation of the complex number. It does not affect the division logic or the failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most suspicious method is the constructor (Method ID 3) because it is responsible for initializing the complex number and potentially handling edge cases like division by zero. The equals method (Method ID 4) is also suspicious but less so than the constructor. The other methods do not seem to contribute to the failure.\n\nHere is the ranking in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor initializes the Complex object and checks for NaN values.
