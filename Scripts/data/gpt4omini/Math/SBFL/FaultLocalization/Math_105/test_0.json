    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `testSSENonNegative` is designed to ensure that the sum of squared errors (SSE) calculated by the `SimpleRegression` class is non-negative. The assertion failure indicates that the calculated SSE is negative, which is not expected.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods:\n\n1. **Method 0: `SimpleRegression()`**\n   - This is the constructor for the `SimpleRegression` class. It initializes the object but does not perform any calculations or data handling. While it is essential for setting up the object, it does not directly contribute to the failure of the test.\n\n2. **Method 1: `addData(double x, double y)`**\n   - This method adds data points to the regression model. It updates several internal state variables (`xbar`, `ybar`, `sumXX`, `sumYY`, `sumXY`, `sumX`, `sumY`, and `n`). The logic here is crucial because if the data is not added correctly, it could lead to incorrect calculations in subsequent methods. The handling of the sums and averages appears to be complex, and any mistake in the logic could lead to incorrect SSE calculations.\n\n3. **Method 2: `getSumSquaredErrors()`**\n   - This method calculates the sum of squared errors using the formula `sumYY - sumXY * sumXY / sumXX`. If `sumXX` is zero or if `sumYY` and `sumXY` are not updated correctly in `addData`, this could lead to a negative result. Given that the test is failing due to a negative SSE, this method is highly suspicious.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\nBased on the analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getSumSquaredErrors method calculates the SSE.
