    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and the stack trace, the test `testNotPositiveDefinite()` is failing due to an expected exception `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException`. This suggests that the methods involved in the Cholesky decomposition are likely the source of the issue. \n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of CholeskyDecompositionImpl checks if the matrix is positive definite.
