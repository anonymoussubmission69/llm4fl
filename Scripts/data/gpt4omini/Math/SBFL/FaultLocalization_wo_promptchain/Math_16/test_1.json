    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and the stack trace, the test `testMath905LargePositive` is failing due to an assertion that expected a maximum error of `0` but received `Infinity`. This suggests that there is an issue with the calculations performed in the methods being tested, particularly those related to hyperbolic functions (`FastMath.cosh` and `FastMath.sinh`).\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'exp' is responsible for calculating the exponential function, which is a fundamental operation in many mathematical computations.
