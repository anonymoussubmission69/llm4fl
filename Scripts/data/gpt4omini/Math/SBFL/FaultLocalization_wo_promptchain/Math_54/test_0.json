This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the `Dfp` class is handling special values like zero and infinity.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toDouble()' is responsible for converting the Dfp object to a double.
