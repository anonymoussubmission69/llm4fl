It is crucial to analyze how the evaluation count is managed.\n3. **BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:computeObjectiveValue(...)** - This method computes the objective value and increments the evaluation count. It is important to check how often this method is called and under what conditions.\n4. **Incrementor:incrementCount()** - This method is responsible for managing the count of evaluations and triggering the exception when the limit is reached. Understanding its logic is essential.\n5. **BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver:doSolve()** - This method orchestrates the solving process and may contain logic that leads to excessive evaluations.\n\nThese methods are critical in understanding why the maximum evaluation count is exceeded, which is the root cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 22, 21, 29, 9]\n}\n```"
