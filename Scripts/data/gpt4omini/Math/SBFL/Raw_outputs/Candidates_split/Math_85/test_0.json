This indicates that the method `inverseCumulativeProbability` in the `NormalDistributionImpl` class is likely not converging properly, which is a critical part of the normal distribution calculations.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability(D)`** - This is the main method being tested and is directly responsible for the failure.\n2. **`getDomainLowerBound(D)`** - This method is called to determine the lower bound for the domain, which could affect the convergence.\n3. **`getDomainUpperBound(D)`** - Similar to the lower bound, this method determines the upper bound and could also impact convergence.\n4. **`getInitialDomain(D)`** - This method provides the initial guess for the domain, which is crucial for the convergence of the algorithm.\n5. **`cumulativeProbability(D)`** - This method is used within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and could be contributing to the failure if it does not return expected results.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 0, 1, 2, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
