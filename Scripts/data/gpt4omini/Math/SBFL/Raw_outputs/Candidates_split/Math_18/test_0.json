This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with how the optimization is being performed, particularly in relation to the boundaries defined for the optimization process.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`optimize(int maxEval, FUNC f, GoalType goalType, double[] start)`** - This method is responsible for performing the optimization. Any issues in how it handles the optimization process could lead to incorrect results.\n   \n2. **`CMAESOptimizer` constructor** - The initialization of the optimizer could affect its behavior. If the parameters are not set correctly, it could lead to unexpected results.\n\n3. **`initializeCMA(double[] guess)`** - This method initializes the CMA-ES algorithm. If the initial guess or the parameters are not set correctly, it could lead to suboptimal results.\n\n4. **`updateCovariance(boolean hsig, final RealMatrix bestArx, ...)`** - This method updates the covariance matrix used in the optimization. If the covariance is not updated correctly, it could lead to incorrect optimization paths.\n\n5. **`value(final double[] point)`** - This method calculates the fitness value for a given point.

If the repair logic is faulty, it could lead to invalid solutions being considered.\n\n7. **`penalty(final double[] x, final double[] repaired)`** - This method applies a penalty to the fitness value based on the repaired solution.
