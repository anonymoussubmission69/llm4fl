"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'ElitisticListPopulation' constructor initializes the elitism rate. The test case is expecting an exception when a negative elitism rate is provided, which indicates that this method should validate the elitism rate. The absence of such validation makes it highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'ListPopulation' constructor checks if the population limit is less than or equal to zero. While it does have a validation for the population limit, it is less suspicious compared to the elitism rate validation in the 'ElitisticListPopulation' constructor, as the test case specifically targets the elitism rate.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
