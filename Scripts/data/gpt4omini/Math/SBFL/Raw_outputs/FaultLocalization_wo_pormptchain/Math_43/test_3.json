"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getResult() method in GeometricMean returns Double.NaN if sumOfLogs.getN() is not greater than 0. This could lead to the NaN result observed in the test failure, indicating that the geometric mean calculation is not being performed correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The evaluate() method in SumOfLogs has a condition that checks if the test passes for the values. If the test fails, it returns NaN. This could be a reason for the NaN result in the test, as it might not be handling the input values correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The setGeoMeanImpl() method calls checkEmpty() before setting the geoMeanImpl. If checkEmpty() does not handle the case where no values have been added, it could lead to an incorrect state for the geometric mean calculation.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getGeometricMean() method retrieves the result from geoMeanImpl. If geoMeanImpl is not set correctly or is in an invalid state, it could return NaN, contributing to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The addValue() method increments various statistics. If any of these increments are not handled correctly, it could lead to an incorrect state for the geometric mean calculation.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
