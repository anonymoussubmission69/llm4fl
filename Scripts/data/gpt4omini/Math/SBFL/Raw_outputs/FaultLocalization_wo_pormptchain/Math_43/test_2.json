"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'Mean:evaluate' method is responsible for calculating the mean of the values.

This suggests that there might be an issue in how the mean is calculated, particularly in handling the input values or the internal state.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'SummaryStatistics:setMeanImpl' method sets the mean implementation and calls 'checkEmpty'.
