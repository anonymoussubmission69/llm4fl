"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The multiply method multiplies the numerator by an integer (in this case, 100) and creates a new Fraction. If the numerator is already large, this multiplication could lead to an overflow, which is likely the cause of the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The percentageValue method calls multiply(100) and then converts the result to a double. If multiply results in an overflow, this will affect the final percentage value returned, leading to discrepancies in the test assertion.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The doubleValue method converts the fraction to a double. If the numerator or denominator is incorrect due to overflow in previous calculations, this will also lead to incorrect results in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor initializes the Fraction object. While it checks for a denominator of zero, it does not handle potential overflow issues when setting the numerator and denominator, which could indirectly affect the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The gcd method is not directly related to the test failure, as it deals with finding the greatest common divisor. However, if it were called in the context of reducing fractions, it could indirectly affect the results, but it is the least suspicious in this context.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
