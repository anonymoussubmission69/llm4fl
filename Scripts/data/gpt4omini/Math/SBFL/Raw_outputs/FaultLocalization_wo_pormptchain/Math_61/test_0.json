"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of PoissonDistributionImpl checks if the mean (p) is less than or equal to zero and throws an IllegalArgumentException if it is. The test case is failing because it attempts to create a PoissonDistributionImpl with a negative mean (-1), which directly triggers this exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This is the first constructor of PoissonDistributionImpl that calls the second constructor. While it does not directly handle the mean validation, it is still part of the chain that leads to the exception being thrown.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for creating the IllegalArgumentException that is thrown when the mean is not positive. It is indirectly related to the failure, as it is invoked when the mean validation fails.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is the constructor for NormalDistributionImpl, which is called within the PoissonDistributionImpl constructor. However, it does not directly relate to the failure since it is not involved in the mean validation.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
