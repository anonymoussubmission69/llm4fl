This method is crucial for ensuring that the input to the 'solve' method is valid, making it highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'verifySequence' method checks if the sequence of values is valid. Although it is not directly related to the interval check, it plays a role in ensuring that the inputs to the solver are in the correct order.
