"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method TestUtils.chiSquare calls the chiSquare method of ChiSquareTestImpl, which is directly involved in calculating the chi-square statistic. The test failed due to an incorrect expected value, indicating a potential issue in this method's logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The chiSquareTest method in ChiSquareTestImpl is responsible for calculating the chi-square test statistic. Since the test failed on the statistic value, this method is highly suspicious as it directly impacts the output.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The chiSquare method in ChiSquareTestImpl computes the chi-square statistic based on the expected and observed values. Any errors in this calculation could lead to the test failure, making it a suspect.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The cumulativeProbability method in ChiSquaredDistributionImpl is used to compute the cumulative probability for the chi-square distribution. If there are issues in how degrees of freedom or probabilities are calculated, it could affect the final result.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
