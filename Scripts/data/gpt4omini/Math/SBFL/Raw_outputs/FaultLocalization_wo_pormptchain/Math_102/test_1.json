"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquare' in TestUtils calls 'chiSquareTest' and is directly involved in the calculation of the chi-square statistic. Since the test failed on the expected value of the chi-square statistic, this method is highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquareTest' in ChiSquareTestImpl is responsible for performing the chi-square test calculation. Given that the test failed due to an incorrect statistic, this method is also very suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquare' in ChiSquareTestImpl computes the chi-square value based on expected and observed values. Since the test involves these values, any issues in this method could lead to incorrect results.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'cumulativeProbability' in ChiSquaredDistributionImpl is used in the calculation of the p-value. If there is an issue with how the cumulative probability is calculated, it could affect the final result.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
