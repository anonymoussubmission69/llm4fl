"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed) calculates the chi-square statistic. The test failure indicates that the expected statistic does not match the calculated value, suggesting a potential issue in this method's logic or its handling of input data.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed) is responsible for performing the chi-square test. Since it directly calls the chiSquare method and returns a value that is being asserted in the test, any error in this method could lead to the observed test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The cumulativeProbability(double x) method in ChiSquaredDistributionImpl is called within the chiSquareTest method. If there is an issue with how the cumulative probability is calculated, it could affect the final result of the chi-square test.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The cumulativeProbability(double x) method in GammaDistributionImpl is also part of the calculation chain.
