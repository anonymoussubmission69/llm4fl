"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'chiSquare' computes the chi-square statistic based on observed and expected values.

Given that the test failed on the p-value as well, this method is also very suspicious as it is directly related to the test's failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'cumulativeProbability' in 'ChiSquaredDistributionImpl' is responsible for calculating the cumulative probability, which is a key part of the p-value calculation.
