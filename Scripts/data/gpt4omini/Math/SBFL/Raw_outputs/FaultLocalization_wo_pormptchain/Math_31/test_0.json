"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'evaluate' method in the ContinuedFraction class is responsible for evaluating the continued fraction. The stack trace indicates that the continued fraction diverged to NaN, which suggests that there may be an issue with how this method handles certain inputs, particularly when the input leads to undefined or infinite values.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'regularizedBeta' method is called multiple times in the stack trace and is likely involved in the calculations leading to the divergence. If this method does not handle edge cases properly, it could lead to NaN results, which is critical in the context of probability distributions.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'cumulativeProbability' method in the BinomialDistribution class is responsible for calculating cumulative probabilities. If it does not handle certain values correctly, it could lead to invalid results that propagate through the calculations, potentially causing the divergence.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'inverseCumulativeProbability' method is crucial for finding the inverse of cumulative probabilities.
