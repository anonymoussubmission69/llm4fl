"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The computeObjectiveValue method is responsible for evaluating the function at a given point and increments the evaluation count. If the evaluation count exceeds the maximum allowed, it throws a TooManyEvaluationsException. This method is directly related to the failure since the exception indicates that the maximum evaluation count was exceeded.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The incrementEvaluationCount method increments the evaluation count and throws a TooManyEvaluationsException if the count exceeds the maximum.
