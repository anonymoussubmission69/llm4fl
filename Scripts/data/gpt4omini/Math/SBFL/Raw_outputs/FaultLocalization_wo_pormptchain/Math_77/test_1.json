"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getLInfNorm() is suspicious because it incorrectly calculates the maximum value. The return statement is inside the loop, which means it will return after the first iteration, leading to incorrect results.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getL1Norm() is also suspicious as it has a similar issue where the return statement is inside the loop, causing it to return the sum after the first element instead of summing all elements.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getNorm() is less suspicious but still noteworthy. It calculates the norm but has a return statement inside the loop, which could lead to incorrect results if the data array has more than one element.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor method <init>([D)V is the least suspicious as it simply clones the input array and does not contain any logic that could lead to a failure in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
