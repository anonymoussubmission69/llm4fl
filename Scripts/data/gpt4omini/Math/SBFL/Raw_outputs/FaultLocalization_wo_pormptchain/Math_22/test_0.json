"Based on the provided test failure information and the methods covered by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method isSupportLowerBoundInclusive() always returns true, which contradicts the expected false in the test.

If the support lower bound is expected to be inclusive, this could affect the outcome of isSupportLowerBoundInclusive().\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The density() method is involved in the distribution calculations. If there is an issue with how density is calculated, it could indirectly affect the support bounds.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of FDistribution initializes the degrees of freedom.
