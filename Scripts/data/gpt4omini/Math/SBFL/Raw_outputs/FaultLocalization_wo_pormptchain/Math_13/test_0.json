"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The EigenDecomposition constructor is called during the optimization process, which is likely where the OutOfMemoryError originates. This method is responsible for transforming a matrix, and if the matrix is too large, it can lead to excessive memory usage.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The squareRoot method in AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer is called during the optimization process. If the weight matrix is large, this could lead to high memory consumption, contributing to the OutOfMemoryError.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getData method in DiagonalMatrix is called to retrieve the matrix data. If the matrix is large, this could also lead to memory issues, especially if it is being used in a context that requires a lot of data to be held in memory.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The TriDiagonalTransformer constructor is called, which initializes several arrays based on the input matrix. If the input matrix is large, this could lead to memory issues as well.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The fit method in PolynomialFitter is called, which may involve creating large arrays for fitting the polynomial. If the degree of the polynomial is high, this could lead to increased memory usage.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the likelihood that each method contributes to the OutOfMemoryError observed in the test. The methods that deal directly with matrix operations and transformations are prioritized, as they are more likely to cause memory issues when handling large datasets."
