"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of RectangularCholeskyDecomposition initializes the decomposition process. If there is an issue with the input matrix (e.g., not being positive definite), it could lead to incorrect results in the subsequent calculations, which might cause the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getRootMatrix method returns the root matrix after decomposition. If the decomposition was not performed correctly due to issues in the constructor, this method would return an incorrect matrix, leading to assertion failures in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The subtract method is used to calculate the difference between the original matrix and the rebuilt matrix. If either matrix is incorrect due to previous errors, this method will yield an incorrect result, causing the assertion to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getNorm method calculates the norm of a matrix. If the matrices involved in the norm calculation are incorrect, the norm will also be incorrect, leading to a failed assertion in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
