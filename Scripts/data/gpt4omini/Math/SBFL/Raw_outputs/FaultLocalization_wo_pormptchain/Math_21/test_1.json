"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of RectangularCholeskyDecomposition initializes the decomposition process. If there is an issue with the input matrix or the decomposition logic, it could lead to incorrect results, which would affect the subsequent calculations in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getRootMatrix method returns the root matrix from the decomposition. If the root matrix is not computed correctly due to issues in the constructor or the decomposition logic, it would lead to incorrect results in the test assertions.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The subtract method is used to calculate the difference between the original matrix and the rebuilt matrix. If there is an error in the matrix operations, it could lead to incorrect results in the norm calculation.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getNorm method calculates the norm of a matrix. If the matrix is not correctly formed or if there are issues in the matrix operations, the norm calculation could yield incorrect results, affecting the test assertions.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the likelihood that issues in these methods would directly impact the failing assertions in the test."
