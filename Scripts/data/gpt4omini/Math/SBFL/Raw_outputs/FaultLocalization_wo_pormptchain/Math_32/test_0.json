"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'computeGeometricalProperties' in 'PolyhedronsSet' is responsible for calculating geometrical properties, which is directly related to the size and boundary size assertions in the test. The ClassCastException indicates that there might be an issue with the type of attributes being processed, which could originate from this method.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'visitInternalNode' in 'FacetsContributionVisitor' is involved in processing boundary attributes. Since the exception is related to casting a boundary attribute, this method could be where the incorrect type is being introduced.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 83,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getPlusOutside' in 'BoundaryAttribute' retrieves the plus outside sub-hyperplane. If the boundary attribute is not correctly set or is of the wrong type, it could lead to the ClassCastException observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getPlusInside' in 'BoundaryAttribute' retrieves the plus inside sub-hyperplane. Similar to 'getPlusOutside', if the boundary attribute is not correctly set or is of the wrong type, it could contribute to the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 71,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getSize' in 'AbstractSubHyperplane' retrieves the size of the remaining region. If the remaining region is not properly defined or has an incorrect type, it could lead to issues during size calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the direct involvement of the methods in the geometrical properties calculations and the handling of boundary attributes, which are critical to the test that is failing."
