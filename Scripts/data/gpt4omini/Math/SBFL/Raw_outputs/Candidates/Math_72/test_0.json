"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testRootEndpoints` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected value is `Math.PI` but the actual result is `1.2246467991473532E-16`. This indicates that the method responsible for calculating the root is not returning the expected value.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **BrentSolver:solve(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDD)D** - This method is directly involved in solving the function and is likely where the error originates.\n2. **UnivariateRealSolverImpl:verifySequence(DDD)V** - This method checks the sequence of the input values, which could affect the solving process.\n3. **UnivariateRealSolverImpl:isSequence(DDD)Z** - This method is used to determine if the input values are in a valid sequence, which is crucial for the solver's operation.\n4. **BrentSolver:solve(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDDDDD)D** - Another variant of the solve method that may be involved in the calculation.\n5. **UnivariateRealSolverImpl:clearResult()V** - This method resets the result, which could impact the outcome if not handled correctly.\n6. **UnivariateRealSolverImpl:setResult(DI)V** - This method sets the result of the solver, and if it is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect outputs.\n7. **UnivariateRealSolverImpl:verifyInterval(DD)V** - This method checks the validity of the interval, which is important for the solver's operation.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
