"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testGcd` is designed to validate the behavior of the `gcd` method in the `MathUtils` class. The test is failing specifically when it expects an `ArithmeticException` to be thrown for the input `MathUtils.gcd(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 0)`, but it does not occur, leading to an assertion failure.\n\nThe covered method from the failed test is:\n- `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)`\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. The test case is checking various scenarios for the `gcd` method, including edge cases with zero and negative values.\n2. The specific failure occurs when the method is called with `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `0`, which is expected to throw an `ArithmeticException`. This indicates that there might be a missing condition in the `gcd` method to handle this specific case.\n3. The method `gcd` is the only method covered by the failed test, and it is directly related to the failure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is the `gcd` method in the `MathUtils` class.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The potential suspicious method's ids\n}\n```"
