"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testQuinticMin` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected result does not match the actual result. The expected value is `-0.2719561270319131`, but the actual value returned is `-0.2719561299044896`. This indicates that there may be an issue with the optimization process or the function being optimized.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the optimization process:\n\n1. **`optimize`** - This method is responsible for performing the optimization and is likely where the discrepancy in results originates.\n2. **`getOptima`** - This method retrieves the optimal values computed, and if the optimization process is flawed, it could lead to incorrect results.\n3. **`getOptimaValues`** - Similar to `getOptima`, this method retrieves the values associated with the optimal points and could also be a source of error.\n4. **`computeObjectiveValue`** - This method computes the objective function value, which is critical in determining the optimization outcome.\n5. **`setResult`** - This method sets the result of the optimization, and if it is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect assertions in the test.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [7, 5, 6, 11, 8]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
