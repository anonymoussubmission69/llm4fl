"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIssue631` is designed to find a root of the function `f(x) = exp(x) - \u03c0^3` using the `RegulaFalsiSolver`.\n2. The test fails due to a `TooManyEvaluationsException`, which indicates that the maximum number of evaluations (3,624) was exceeded during the solving process.\n3. The stack trace points to several methods in the `BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver` and `BaseSecantSolver` classes, particularly the `incrementEvaluationCount` method, which is responsible for tracking the number of evaluations and throwing the exception when the limit is exceeded.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:incrementEvaluationCount()`** - This method is directly responsible for incrementing the evaluation count and throwing the exception when the limit is exceeded.\n2. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:computeObjectiveValue(double)`** - This method calls `incrementEvaluationCount()` and is involved in evaluating the function.\n3. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:solve(int, UnivariateRealFunction, double, double)`** - This method orchestrates the solving process and may influence how evaluations are counted.\n4. **`BaseSecantSolver:doSolve()`** - This method implements the core logic of the secant method and may be where the excessive evaluations are occurring.\n5. **`BaseSecantSolver:solve(int, UnivariateRealFunction, double, double, double)`** - Similar to the previous method, this one is also involved in the solving process.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [24, 25, 27, 11, 10]\n}\n```"
