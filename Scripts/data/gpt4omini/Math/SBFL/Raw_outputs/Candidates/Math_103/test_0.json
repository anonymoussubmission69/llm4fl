"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testExtremeValues` is designed to test the `cumulativeProbability` method of the `NormalDistribution` class with extreme values.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `MaxIterationsExceededException` was thrown, which suggests that the method `regularizedGammaP` in the `Gamma` class is likely involved in an iterative process that exceeded its maximum allowed iterations.\n3. The `cumulativeProbability` method calls the `erf` method, which in turn calls `regularizedGammaP`. This indicates that both `cumulativeProbability` and `erf` are also suspicious.\n4. The `setStandardDeviation` method has a condition that checks if the standard deviation is less than or equal to zero, which could potentially lead to issues if not handled properly.\n\nBased on these points, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n- `org.apache.commons.math.special.Gamma:regularizedGammaP(DDDI)D` (method_id: 10)\n- `org.apache.commons.math.special.Erf:erf(D)D` (method_id: 3)\n- `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl:cumulativeProbability(D)D` (method_id: 2)\n- `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl:setStandardDeviation(D)V` (method_id: 6)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 3, 2, 6]\n}\n```"
