"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIssue631` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` related to an expected exception `TooManyEvaluationsException`. This suggests that the method being tested is likely exceeding the maximum number of evaluations allowed during the root-finding process.\n\nThe test involves the `RegulaFalsiSolver` class, which is a specific implementation of a root-finding algorithm. The test calls the `solve` method of the `RegulaFalsiSolver`, which in turn calls several other methods to perform the calculations.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n1. **`RegulaFalsiSolver` Constructor**: This initializes the solver and sets default parameters.\n   - Method ID: 0\n\n2. **`BaseSecantSolver:solve`**: This method is responsible for solving the equation and may be where the evaluation count is managed.\n   - Method ID: 1\n\n3. **`BaseSecantSolver:doSolve`**: This method contains the core logic for the solving process and is likely where the evaluations are counted and checked.\n   - Method ID: 4\n\n4. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:incrementEvaluationCount`**: This method increments the evaluation count and is crucial for understanding how many evaluations have been performed.\n   - Method ID: 18\n\n5. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:setup`**: This method sets up the solver with the function and evaluation limits, which could be related to the maximum evaluations.\n   - Method ID: 19\n\n6. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:computeObjectiveValue`**: This method computes the value of the function at a given point and increments the evaluation count.\n   - Method ID: 17\n\n7. **`Incrementor:incrementCount`**: This method checks if the count exceeds the maximum allowed evaluations, which is directly related to the exception being thrown.\n   - Method ID: 22\n\n### Conclusion\nThe methods listed above are all related to the evaluation process of the root-finding algorithm and are likely candidates for further investigation to determine why the `TooManyEvaluationsException` is being thrown.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 17, 18, 19, 22]\n}\n```"
