"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion error where the expected chi-square test statistic did not match the actual value. This indicates that there may be an issue in the calculation of the chi-square statistic or the parameters being passed to the method.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for calculating the chi-square test statistic. Any issues in the logic here could directly lead to the discrepancy in the expected and actual values.\n\n2. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method seems to be involved in the calculation of the chi-square value as well. It contains logic that checks the validity of the input arrays and computes the sum of squares, which could also be a source of error.\n\n3. **`cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is used to compute the cumulative probability based on the chi-square distribution. If the parameters passed to it are incorrect, it could lead to an incorrect probability calculation.\n\n4. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if the expected values are positive. If it incorrectly identifies the values, it could lead to incorrect calculations in the chi-square methods.\n\n5. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - Similar to `isPositive`, this method checks if the observed values are non-negative. An error here could also affect the calculations.\n\n6. **`setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)`** - This method sets the degrees of freedom for the distribution. If the degrees of freedom are set incorrectly, it could lead to incorrect statistical calculations.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 6, 1, 7, 8, 15]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
