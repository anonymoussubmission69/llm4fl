"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failure is related to a chi-square test statistic where the expected value does not match the actual value. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `assertEquals` method of the JUnit framework, specifically in the `testChiSquare` method of the `ChiSquareTestTest` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to the chi-square test and the gamma distribution. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is responsible for performing the chi-square test and is directly related to the test that failed.\n2. **`cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is part of the chi-squared distribution implementation and is called within the chi-square test method.\n3. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method calculates the chi-square statistic and is also directly related to the test that failed.\n4. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if the expected values are positive, which is crucial for the chi-square test.\n5. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - This method checks if the observed values are non-negative, which is also important for the validity of the chi-square test.\n\nThese methods are critical to the functionality of the chi-square test and any issues within them could lead to the discrepancies observed in the test results.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]\n}\n```"
