"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the failure occurred in the `PearsonsCorrelationTest.testPValueNearZero` method, which indicates that there might be an issue with the calculation of the p-value in the `PearsonsCorrelation` class. The stack trace shows that an assertion failed, which suggests that the expected value did not match the actual value returned by the method being tested.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `PearsonsCorrelation` class, which are likely candidates for investigation. Here are the methods that should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`PearsonsCorrelation.getCorrelationPValues()`** - This method is directly related to the calculation of p-values, which is the focus of the test.\n2. **`PearsonsCorrelation.computeCorrelationMatrix(RealMatrix)`** - This method computes the correlation matrix, which is essential for calculating p-values.\n3. **`PearsonsCorrelation.correlation(double[], double[])`** - This method calculates the correlation between two arrays, which is fundamental to the correlation matrix and p-value calculations.\n4. **`SimpleRegression.getR()`** - This method is used to get the correlation coefficient, which is part of the p-value calculation.\n5. **`SimpleRegression.getRSquare()`** - This method calculates the R-squared value, which is also relevant to the correlation and p-value calculations.\n\nThese methods are all interconnected in the process of calculating the p-values, and any issues in their implementation could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 5, 6, 8]\n}\n```"
