"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **EigenDecompositionImpl.<init>([D[DD)V**: This is the constructor of the `EigenDecompositionImpl` class. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurred during the initialization of this class, which suggests that there might be an issue with the input parameters or the initialization logic.\n\n2. **EigenDecompositionImpl.computeShiftIncrement(III)V**: This method is involved in computing the shift increment, which is critical in the eigenvalue decomposition process. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred, which could be related to how indices are managed in this method.\n\n3. **EigenDecompositionImpl.goodStep(II)I**: This method is part of the iterative process for finding eigenvalues. If there are issues with the indices or the logic for determining the next steps, it could lead to exceptions.\n\n4. **EigenDecompositionImpl.processGeneralBlock(I)V**: This method processes a block of the matrix. If the block size or indices are not handled correctly, it could lead to out-of-bounds errors.\n\n5. **EigenDecompositionImpl.findEigenvalues()V**: This method is responsible for finding the eigenvalues. If there are issues with the input data or the logic used to find the eigenvalues, it could lead to exceptions.\n\n6. **EigenDecompositionImpl.decompose()V**: This method is responsible for performing the decomposition. If there are issues with the input data or the internal state of the object, it could lead to exceptions.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 10, 3, 1, 14, 12]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the eigenvalue decomposition process and are likely candidates for further investigation to identify the root cause of the failure."
