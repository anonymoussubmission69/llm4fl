"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed due to an assertion error where the expected value was a number, but the actual value was `NaN` (Not a Number). This indicates that there is likely an issue in the computation of the geometric mean, which is typically calculated using logarithmic values. \n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`checkEmpty()`** - This method checks if the statistics are empty. If it is called and the statistics are empty, it may lead to `NaN` results.\n2. **`setGeoMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic geoMeanImpl)`** - This method sets the implementation for the geometric mean. If the implementation is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect calculations.\n3. **`addValue(double value)`** - This method adds a value to the statistics. If the value being added is invalid (e.g., negative or zero for logarithmic calculations), it could lead to `NaN`.\n4. **`getGeometricMean()`** - This method retrieves the geometric mean. If the underlying implementation is not functioning correctly, it could return `NaN`.\n5. **`SumOfLogs:increment(double d)`** - This method increments the sum of logs. If `d` is less than or equal to zero, it will lead to `NaN` when calculating the logarithm.\n6. **`GeometricMean:getResult()`** - This method retrieves the result of the geometric mean calculation. If the sum of logs is not valid, it could return `NaN`.\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the computation of the geometric mean and could potentially lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 14, 9, 25]\n}\n```"
