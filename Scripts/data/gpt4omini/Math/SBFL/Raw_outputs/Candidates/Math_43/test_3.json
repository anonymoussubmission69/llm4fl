"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideGeoMeanWithMathClass` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected geometric mean is `2.213363839400643`, but the actual result is `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the geometric mean, which is being handled by the `GeometricMean` class.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`checkEmpty()`** - This method checks if the number of values (`n`) is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, it may lead to issues in calculations.\n2. **`setGeoMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic geoMeanImpl)`** - This method sets the implementation for the geometric mean. If the implementation is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect results.\n3. **`addValue(double value)`** - This method adds a value to the statistics. If there are issues in how values are added or if the geometric mean implementation is not compatible, it could lead to `NaN`.\n4. **`getGeometricMean()`** - This method retrieves the geometric mean. If the underlying implementation is returning `NaN`, it needs to be investigated.\n5. **`GeometricMean:getResult()`** - This method returns the result of the geometric mean calculation. If the sum of logs is not computed correctly, it could return `NaN`.\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the computation of the geometric mean and are likely to be the source of the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 14, 25]\n}\n```"
