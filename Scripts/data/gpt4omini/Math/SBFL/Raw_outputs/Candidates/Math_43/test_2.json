"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideMeanWithMathClass` is failing because it expected a mean value of `2.5` but received `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the mean, which could be related to how values are added or how the mean is computed.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`checkEmpty()`** - This method checks if the number of values (`n`) is greater than 0. If `n` is not updated correctly, it could lead to incorrect mean calculations.\n2. **`setMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic meanImpl)`** - This method sets the implementation for calculating the mean. If the mean implementation is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect results.\n3. **`addValue(double value)`** - This method is responsible for adding values to the statistics. If there is an issue in how values are added or if the mean implementation is not compatible, it could lead to `NaN`.\n4. **`evaluate(double[] values, int begin, int length)`** in the `Mean` class - This method computes the mean from the provided values. If the input values are not valid or if the computation logic has a flaw, it could return `NaN`.\n5. **`getMean()`** - This method retrieves the mean value. If the mean implementation has not been set correctly or if it has not computed a valid result, it could return `NaN`.\n\nThese methods are critical in the computation of the mean and should be investigated to identify the root cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 16, 26]\n}\n```"
