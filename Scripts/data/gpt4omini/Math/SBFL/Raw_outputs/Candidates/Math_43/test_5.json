"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOverrideVarianceWithMathClass` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected variance is `1.25`, but the actual result is `NaN`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of variance within the `SummaryStatistics` class or its associated methods.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`checkEmpty()`** - This method checks if the statistics are empty. If it is not properly handling the case when no values have been added, it could lead to incorrect calculations.\n   \n2. **`setVarianceImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic varianceImpl)`** - This method sets the variance implementation. If the variance implementation is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect variance calculations.\n\n3. **`addValue(double value)`** - This method adds a value to the statistics. If there is an issue in how values are being added or if it does not handle edge cases (like NaN values), it could affect the variance calculation.\n\n4. **`getVariance()`** - This method retrieves the variance. If the underlying variance implementation is not functioning correctly, it could return NaN.\n\n5. **`Variance:evaluate(double[] values)`** - This method evaluates the variance for a given set of values. If there are issues in the logic for calculating variance, it could lead to NaN results.\n\n6. **`Variance:getResult()`** - This method retrieves the result of the variance calculation. If the internal state is not correctly maintained, it could return NaN.\n\n7. **`Variance:evaluate(double[] values, int begin, int length)`** - This method evaluates the variance for a specific range of values. If the range is not handled correctly, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 30, 25, 32, 28]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be investigated to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
