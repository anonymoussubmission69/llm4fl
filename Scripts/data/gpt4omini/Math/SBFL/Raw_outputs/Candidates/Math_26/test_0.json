"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIntegerOverflow` is designed to check for integer overflow conditions when converting a double to a fraction. The test fails because an exception was expected to be thrown, but it was not. \n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `checkIntegerOverflow` method, which is likely responsible for validating the overflow conditions. The methods that are covered by the failed test include constructors and methods related to exceptions and the `Fraction` class, which are relevant to the overflow checks.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **FractionConversionException Constructor**: This method is responsible for creating an exception when a fraction conversion fails due to overflow. If this exception is not being thrown when it should, it could be a source of the problem.\n   - Method ID: 0\n\n2. **Fraction Constructor (double, double, int)**: This constructor initializes a `Fraction` object and may contain logic that checks for overflow conditions. If the logic is incorrect, it may not throw the expected exception.\n   - Method ID: 4\n\n3. **Fraction Constructor (double, double, int, int)**: This private constructor contains the logic for checking overflow and throwing the `FractionConversionException`. This is the most critical method to analyze since it directly handles the overflow logic.\n   - Method ID: 5\n\n4. **FastMath.floor**: This method is used to calculate the floor of a double value. If there are issues with how it handles large values, it could lead to incorrect behavior in the `Fraction` constructors.\n   - Method ID: 10\n\n5. **FastMath.abs**: This method is used to get the absolute value of a double. Similar to `floor`, if it does not handle edge cases correctly, it could affect the calculations in the `Fraction` constructors.\n   - Method ID: 11\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 4, 5, 10, 11]\n}\n```"
