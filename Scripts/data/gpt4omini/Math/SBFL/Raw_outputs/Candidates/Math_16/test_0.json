"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath905LargeNegative` is failing due to an assertion that expected a maximum error (`maxErr`) of `0.0`, but instead received `Infinity`. This suggests that there is an issue with the calculations performed in the methods being tested, specifically related to the hyperbolic functions `cosh` and `sinh` from the `FastMath` class.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`FastMath.cosh(double x)`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the error originates, especially since the test is comparing the result of `FastMath.cosh(x)` with `Math.cosh(x)`.\n2. **`FastMath.sinh(double x)`** - Similar to `cosh`, this method is also directly involved in the test and could be contributing to the error.\n3. **`FastMath.ulp(double x)`** - This method is used to calculate the unit in the last place, which is involved in the error calculation. If it does not handle edge cases correctly, it could lead to an `Infinity` result.\n4. **`FastMath.exp(double x)`** - Since both `cosh` and `sinh` rely on exponential calculations, any issues in the `exp` method could propagate and cause the observed failure.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 17, 20]\n}\n```\n\nIn this JSON:\n- `0` corresponds to `FastMath.cosh(double x)`.\n- `1` corresponds to `FastMath.sinh(double x)`.\n- `17` corresponds to `FastMath.ulp(double x)`.\n- `20` corresponds to `FastMath.exp(double x)`. \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
