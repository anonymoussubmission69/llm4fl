"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testArrayEquals` is designed to verify the behavior of the `MathUtils.equals` methods, particularly for comparing double values and arrays of doubles. The test fails at the assertion that checks if two arrays containing `Double.NaN` are equal, which indicates a potential issue in the `equals(double[] x, double[] y)` method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `MathUtils.equals(double x, double y)` - This method checks if two double values are equal, considering the special case of `NaN`.\n2. `MathUtils.equals(double[] x, double[] y)` - This method checks if two arrays of doubles are equal, including handling null values.\n\nThe failure in the test suggests that there might be a logical error in how the `equals` methods handle `NaN` values, particularly in the array comparison method.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. `MathUtils.equals(double x, double y)` - Needs to be checked for correct handling of `NaN`.\n2. `MathUtils.equals(double[] x, double[] y)` - Needs to be checked for correct handling of array comparisons, especially with `NaN`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
