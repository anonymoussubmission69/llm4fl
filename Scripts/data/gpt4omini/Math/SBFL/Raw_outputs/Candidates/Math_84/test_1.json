"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMinimizeMaximize` is designed to test the optimization functionality of the `MultiDirectional` class. The test fails at line 103, which indicates that an assertion related to the optimizer's evaluations is not met.\n2. The stack trace shows that the failure is due to an `AssertionFailedError`, which suggests that the expected conditions regarding the optimizer's evaluations are not being satisfied.\n3. The methods involved in the optimization process, particularly those related to the evaluation and iteration of the simplex, are critical to investigate. These methods include:\n   - `optimize` (method_id: 11)\n   - `evaluateSimplex` (method_id: 14)\n   - `iterateSimplex` (method_id: 1)\n   - `incrementIterationsCounter` (method_id: 4)\n   - `getEvaluations` (method_id: 19)\n\nThese methods are directly related to the optimization process and the evaluation of the function being minimized or maximized. Any issues in these methods could lead to incorrect evaluations or iterations, resulting in the test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 11, 14, 19]\n}\n```"
