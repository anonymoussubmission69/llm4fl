"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMean()` is designed to check the behavior of the `PoissonDistributionImpl` class when initialized with a negative mean. The stack trace indicates that an exception is thrown when the constructor of `PoissonDistributionImpl` is called with a negative value, which is expected behavior.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`PoissonDistributionImpl.<init>(D)`** - This is the constructor that takes a single double parameter. It delegates to another constructor and is directly involved in the instantiation of the `PoissonDistributionImpl` object with a negative mean.\n\n2. **`PoissonDistributionImpl.<init>(DDI)`** - This constructor checks if the mean is less than or equal to zero and throws an exception if it is. This method is crucial as it contains the logic that leads to the exception being thrown.\n\n3. **`MathRuntimeException.createIllegalArgumentException(...)`** - This method is responsible for creating the exception that is thrown when the mean is invalid. It is indirectly involved in the failure.\n\nThe other methods related to `NormalDistributionImpl` and utility methods do not seem to be directly related to the failure in this context.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 7]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 0**: `PoissonDistributionImpl.<init>(D)` - Directly involved in the instantiation.\n- **Method ID 1**: `PoissonDistributionImpl.<init>(DDI)` - Contains the logic that checks for the mean's validity.\n- **Method ID 7**: `MathRuntimeException.createIllegalArgumentException(...)` - Responsible for creating the exception thrown."
