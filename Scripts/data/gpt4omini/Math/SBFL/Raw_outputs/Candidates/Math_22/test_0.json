"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failed because it expected a value of `false` but received `true`. This indicates that there is a logical error in the method being tested, specifically in the `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()` method of the `FDistribution` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `FDistribution` class and other related classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`**: This method is directly related to the test that failed. It is expected to return `false`, but it currently returns `true`. This is the primary suspect.\n   \n2. **`density(double x)`**: This method may influence the behavior of the distribution and could be indirectly related to the support lower bound logic.\n\n3. **`getSupportLowerBound()`**: This method returns the lower bound of the support, which could be relevant to understanding why `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()` is returning `true`.\n\n4. **Constructors of `FDistribution`**: The constructors may set up the state of the object incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior in the methods.\n\n5. **`logBeta(double a, double b)`**: This method is a static utility that may be used in calculations related to the distribution and could affect the results.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2]\n}\n``` \n\n- **0**: `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`\n- **1**: `density(double x)`\n- **3**: `getSupportLowerBound()`\n- **4**: `FDistribution(double numeratorDegreesOfFreedom, double denominatorDegreesOfFreedom)`\n- **5**: `FDistribution(double numeratorDegreesOfFreedom, double denominatorDegreesOfFreedom, double inverseCumAccuracy)`\n- **2**: `logBeta(double a, double b)` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to determine the root cause of the failure in the test."
