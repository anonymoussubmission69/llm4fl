"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation:\n\n1. **CMAESOptimizer:doOptimize()** - This method is responsible for the optimization process and contains multiple iterations and calculations that could lead to incorrect results if not implemented correctly.\n2. **CMAESOptimizer:initializeCMA(double[] guess)** - This method initializes parameters for the optimization process. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to failures in the optimization.\n3. **CMAESOptimizer:push(double[] vals, double val)** - This method modifies the fitness history, which is crucial for tracking the optimization process. Any issues here could affect the results.\n4. **CMAESOptimizer:sortedIndices(double[] doubles)** - This method sorts indices based on fitness values. If sorting is incorrect, it could lead to wrong selections in the optimization process.\n5. **CMAESOptimizer:checkParameters()** - This method checks the parameters for validity. If parameters are not validated correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior during optimization.\n\nThese methods are critical in the optimization process and any faults in their implementation could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 4, 5, 37]\n}\n```"
