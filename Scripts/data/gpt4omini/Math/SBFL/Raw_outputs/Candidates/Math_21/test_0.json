"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **RectangularCholeskyDecomposition Constructor** (`RectangularCholeskyDecomposition:<init>`): This method initializes the decomposition and is critical in determining if the input matrix is positive definite. If the matrix is not positive definite, it could lead to incorrect results in subsequent calculations.\n\n2. **getRootMatrix** (`RectangularCholeskyDecomposition:getRootMatrix`): This method retrieves the root matrix from the decomposition. If the decomposition was not performed correctly, this could lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **getNorm** (`AbstractRealMatrix:getNorm`): This method calculates the norm of the matrix. The failure in the test indicates that the norm of the difference between the original and rebuilt matrix is not zero, suggesting that there may be an issue in how the norm is calculated or how the matrices are being manipulated.\n\n4. **subtract** (`AbstractRealMatrix:subtract`): This method is used to compute the difference between two matrices. If there is an error in the subtraction logic, it could lead to incorrect results in the norm calculation.\n\n5. **multiply** (`AbstractRealMatrix:multiply`): This method is responsible for multiplying two matrices. If the multiplication is not performed correctly, it could affect the rebuilt matrix and thus the norm calculation.\n\n6. **createRealMatrix** (`MatrixUtils:createRealMatrix`): This method creates a new matrix from the provided data. If the matrix is not created correctly, it could lead to issues in the subsequent calculations.\n\n7. **checkMultiplicationCompatible** (`MatrixUtils:checkMultiplicationCompatible`): This method checks if two matrices can be multiplied. If this check fails or is not handled correctly, it could lead to runtime errors or incorrect results.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 15, 7, 8, 9]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the matrix operations being performed in the test, and any issues within them could lead to the observed failure."
