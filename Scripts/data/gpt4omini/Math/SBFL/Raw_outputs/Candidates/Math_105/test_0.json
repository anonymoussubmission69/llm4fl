"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSSENonNegative` is designed to check that the sum of squared errors calculated by the `SimpleRegression` class is non-negative. The test fails with an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the assertion `reg.getSumSquaredErrors() >= 0.0` is not satisfied.\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test that are relevant to this assertion are:\n\n1. **SimpleRegression Constructor** (`SimpleRegression:<init>()V`): This method initializes the `SimpleRegression` object. If there are issues with the initialization, it could lead to incorrect calculations later.\n\n2. **addData Method** (`SimpleRegression:addData(DD)V`): This method adds data points to the regression model. If there is a bug in how data is added or how the internal state is updated, it could affect the sum of squared errors.\n\n3. **getSumSquaredErrors Method** (`SimpleRegression:getSumSquaredErrors()D`): This method calculates and returns the sum of squared errors. Since the test is directly checking the output of this method, any fault here would directly cause the test to fail.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be examined further are:\n\n- The constructor for proper initialization.\n- The `addData` method for correct data handling.\n- The `getSumSquaredErrors` method for accurate calculations.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
