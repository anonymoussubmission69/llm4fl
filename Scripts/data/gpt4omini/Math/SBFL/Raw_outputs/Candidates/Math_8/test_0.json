"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIssue942` is attempting to sample from a `DiscreteDistribution` using a list of pairs, where each pair consists of an object and a probability. The test expects the sample size to be 1.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayStoreException` occurred in the `sample` method of the `DiscreteDistribution` class. This suggests that there may be an issue with the types being stored in the array, likely due to a mismatch between the expected type and the actual type being used.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **DiscreteDistribution Constructor**: `DiscreteDistribution:<init>(Ljava/util/List;)V` (method_id: 0)\n   - This method initializes the `DiscreteDistribution` with a list of pairs. If the pairs are not correctly formed or if the probabilities are not valid, it could lead to issues in sampling.\n\n2. **Sample Method**: `DiscreteDistribution:sample(I)[Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 1)\n   - This method is directly involved in the sampling process and is where the `ArrayStoreException` occurred. It is crucial to analyze how the sampling is performed and whether the types being used are consistent.\n\n3. **Sample Method (No Argument)**: `DiscreteDistribution:sample()Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 2)\n   - This method is called within the `sample(int sampleSize)` method. It is important to check how it retrieves the next sample and whether it handles the types correctly.\n\n4. **DiscreteDistribution Constructor with RandomGenerator**: `DiscreteDistribution:<init>(Lorg/apache/commons/math3/random/RandomGenerator;Ljava/util/List;)V` (method_id: 4)\n   - This constructor also initializes the distribution and could be relevant if the random generator or the list of pairs is not set up correctly.\n\n5. **MathArrays Normalize Array**: `MathArrays:normalizeArray([DD)[D` (method_id: 6)\n   - This method is used to normalize the probabilities. If the normalization is incorrect, it could lead to invalid probabilities being used in the sampling process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]\n}\n```"
