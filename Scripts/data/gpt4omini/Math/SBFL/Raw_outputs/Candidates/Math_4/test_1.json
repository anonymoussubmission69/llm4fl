"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIntersectionNotIntersecting` is designed to check if two `SubLine` objects do not intersect. The test fails with a `NullPointerException`, which indicates that there is an attempt to access a method or property of a null object.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the exception occurs in the `getAbscissa` method of the `Line` class, which is called by the `toSubSpace` method of the `Line` class, and subsequently by the `intersection` method of the `SubLine` class.\n\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace and the test are:\n   - `SubLine.intersection`\n   - `Line.getAbscissa`\n   - `Line.toSubSpace`\n\n4. The `intersection` method of `SubLine` is critical as it is the method being tested. The `getAbscissa` method is also crucial because it is where the `NullPointerException` originates.\n\n5. The constructors of `SubLine` and `Line` may also be relevant, as they initialize the objects that are being used in the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n- `SubLine.intersection`\n- `Line.getAbscissa`\n- `Line.toSubSpace`\n- `SubLine.<init>`\n- `Line.<init>`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 3, 0, 21]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method IDs correspond to:\n  - `1`: `SubLine.intersection`\n  - `2`: `Line.getAbscissa`\n  - `3`: `Line.toSubSpace`\n  - `0`: `SubLine.<init>`\n  - `21`: `Line.<init>`"
