"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNotPositiveDefinite` is designed to check if a `CholeskyDecomposition` implementation correctly throws a `NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` when provided with a non-positive definite matrix. The stack trace indicates that the expected exception was not thrown, which suggests that there may be an issue in the methods responsible for checking the matrix properties or performing the decomposition.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **CholeskyDecompositionImpl constructor**: This method initializes the decomposition and checks if the matrix is square. If the matrix is not square, it should throw an exception.\n   - Method ID: 0\n\n2. **CholeskyDecompositionImpl constructor with additional parameters**: This constructor likely contains logic to check for positive definiteness and may be where the exception should be thrown.\n   - Method ID: 1\n\n3. **isSquare()**: This method checks if the matrix is square. If it incorrectly returns false for a square matrix, it could lead to the failure of the test.\n   - Method ID: 6\n\n4. **getL()**: This method retrieves the lower triangular matrix. If the decomposition is not performed correctly, it may return an incorrect result.\n   - Method ID: 3\n\n5. **getLT()**: Similar to `getL()`, this method retrieves the transpose of the lower triangular matrix. Issues here could also lead to incorrect results.\n   - Method ID: 4\n\n6. **MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix()**: This method creates a real matrix from the provided data. If the data is not correctly interpreted, it could lead to issues in the decomposition.\n   - Method ID: 5\n\n7. **DenseRealMatrix.getData()**: This method retrieves the underlying data of the matrix. If the data is not structured correctly, it could affect the decomposition.\n   - Method ID: 7\n\n8. **DenseRealMatrix.getEntry()**: This method retrieves a specific entry from the matrix. If it does not return the correct value, it could lead to incorrect calculations during decomposition.\n   - Method ID: 20\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 20]\n}\n```"
