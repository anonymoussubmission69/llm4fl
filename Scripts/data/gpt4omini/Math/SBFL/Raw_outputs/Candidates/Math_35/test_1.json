"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChromosomeListConstructorTooHigh` is designed to check if an `OutOfRangeException` is thrown when an invalid elitism rate (1.25) is provided to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The stack trace indicates that the expected exception was not thrown, which suggests that there may be an issue in the constructor logic of the `ElitisticListPopulation` or its superclass `ListPopulation`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor\n2. `ListPopulation` constructor\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`ElitisticListPopulation` constructor**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for initializing the elitism rate. If the exception is not being thrown as expected, this method needs to be examined for proper validation of the elitism rate.\n   \n2. **`ListPopulation` constructor**: This method is called by the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. It contains logic that checks the size of the chromosomes against the population limit. If the population limit is not being validated correctly, it could lead to the failure of the test.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are crucial in understanding why the expected exception was not thrown. The `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor should be checked for proper handling of the elitism rate, while the `ListPopulation` constructor should be reviewed for its validation logic.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
