"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChromosomeListConstructorTooLow` is designed to check if an exception is thrown when an invalid elitism rate (negative value) is provided to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The expected exception is `OutOfRangeException`, which indicates that the input values are not within the acceptable range.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the test fails because the expected exception is not thrown, suggesting that there may be an issue in the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` or its superclass `ListPopulation`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor\n2. `ListPopulation` constructor\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`ElitisticListPopulation` constructor**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for initializing the elitism rate. If it does not properly validate the elitism rate, it could lead to the failure of the test.\n2. **`ListPopulation` constructor**: This method is called within the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. If it does not enforce the population limit correctly or does not handle the case where the elitism rate is negative, it could also be a source of the problem.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are critical to the test's outcome, and their implementations should be reviewed to ensure they correctly handle the input parameters, particularly the elitism rate and population limit.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
