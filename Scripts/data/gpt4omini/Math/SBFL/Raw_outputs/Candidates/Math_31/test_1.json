"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMath785` is failing due to an issue with the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method of the `FDistribution` class. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when trying to calculate the inverse cumulative probability, which suggests that the methods involved in this calculation are likely to be the source of the problem.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is where the failure occurs.\n2. **`cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method to compute the cumulative probability, which is essential for the inverse calculation.\n3. **`getNumericalMean()`** - This method is used to calculate the mean, which is part of the logic in `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n4. **`getNumericalVariance()`** - This method is used to calculate the variance, which is also part of the logic in `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n5. **`getSupportLowerBound()`** and **`getSupportUpperBound()`** - These methods provide the bounds for the distribution, which are critical for the calculations in `inverseCumulativeProbability`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [18, 20, 2, 3, 5, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes the method IDs of the potentially faulty methods that need to be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
