"Based on the analysis of the test and the stack trace, the test is failing due to an assertion error in the chi-square test statistic. The expected value is significantly different from the actual value returned by the method, indicating a potential issue in the calculation logic.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The chiSquare method is responsible for calculating the chi-square statistic. The test failure indicates that the computed statistic is incorrect, which suggests a potential issue in this method's logic or calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The chiSquareTest method uses the chi-square statistic to compute the p-value. If the statistic is incorrect, the p-value will also be incorrect, making this method suspicious as well.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is involved in calculating cumulative probabilities, which are used in statistical tests. If the cumulative probability calculation is incorrect, it could affect the results of the chi-square test.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method calls another cumulative probability method. While it is less directly involved in the chi-square calculation, any issues in the underlying methods could propagate here.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is related to the regularized gamma function, which is used in statistical calculations. It is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure but could still be a contributing factor.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if the input array is positive. While it is important for input validation, it is less likely to be the cause of the test failure unless it incorrectly identifies valid inputs.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if the input array is non-negative. Similar to method 7, it is primarily for validation and is the least likely to be the cause of the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
