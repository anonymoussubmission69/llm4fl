"Based on the analysis of the test and the stack trace, the test `testFullRank` is failing due to an assertion that checks if the norm of the difference between the original matrix `m` and the rebuilt matrix `rebuiltM` is close to zero. The failure indicates that the matrices are not equivalent within the specified tolerance, which suggests a potential issue in the matrix operations involved in the `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition` class.\n\nHere are the method bodies analyzed for potential faults:\n\n1. **Method 0 (`RectangularCholeskyDecomposition`)**: This method is responsible for performing the Cholesky decomposition. It contains complex logic for matrix manipulation and could potentially introduce errors in the decomposition process, especially if the input matrix is not handled correctly.\n\n2. **Method 1 (`getRootMatrix`)**: This method simply returns the `root` matrix. It is unlikely to be the source of the problem since it does not perform any calculations.\n\n3. **Method 3 (`getNorm`)**: This method calculates the norm of the matrix. If the norm calculation is incorrect, it could lead to the failure of the assertion in the test. However, it is less likely to be the root cause compared to the decomposition method.\n\n4. **Method 7 (`multiply`)**: This method performs matrix multiplication. If there is an error in how matrices are multiplied, it could lead to incorrect results in the rebuilt matrix, which would affect the test outcome.\n\n5. **Method 15 (`subtract`)**: This method performs matrix subtraction. Similar to the multiplication method, if there is an error in the subtraction, it could also lead to incorrect results in the norm calculation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The RectangularCholeskyDecomposition method contains complex logic for matrix manipulation and is responsible for the decomposition process.
