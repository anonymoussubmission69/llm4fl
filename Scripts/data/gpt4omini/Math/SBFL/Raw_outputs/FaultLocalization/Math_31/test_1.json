"Based on the analysis of the test and the method bodies, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'inverseCumulativeProbability' is responsible for calculating the inverse cumulative probability, which is directly related to the failing test. The test fails when it attempts to assert that the result is less than 1.0, indicating that there may be an issue with how this method handles edge cases or calculations, particularly when p is close to 0 or 1.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method appears to be a duplicate of method 18, which also calculates the inverse cumulative probability. Since the test failure is related to this calculation, it is equally suspicious as method 18.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getNumericalVariance' is used in the calculation of the mean and variance, which are critical for the inverse cumulative probability calculation. If the variance is incorrectly calculated, it could lead to incorrect results in the inverse cumulative probability method.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getNumericalMean' is also involved in the calculations for the inverse cumulative probability. If the mean is calculated incorrectly, it could affect the results of the probability calculations, making it suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getSupportLowerBound' returns a constant value of 0. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure, it could still play a role in the overall calculations if the bounds are not set correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getSupportUpperBound' returns Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, which is a standard upper bound. It is the least suspicious as it does not involve any calculations that could lead to inaccuracies in the probability results.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
