"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testUnivariateDistribution` is failing because the expected density value from the `NormalDistribution` does not match the density value from the `MultivariateNormalDistribution`. The discrepancy indicates that there may be an issue in the calculation of the density in either the `density` method of `MultivariateNormalDistribution` or the `density` method of `NormalDistribution`.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The density method in MultivariateNormalDistribution is responsible for calculating the density of the multivariate distribution. If this method has an error in its implementation, it could lead to incorrect density values, which would directly affect the test results.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The density method in NormalDistribution calculates the density for a univariate normal distribution. Since the test compares the output of this method with the output of the MultivariateNormalDistribution, any error here could also lead to a test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getExponentTerm method is used in the density calculation of the MultivariateNormalDistribution. If this method does not correctly compute the exponent term, it could lead to incorrect density values.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The preMultiply method is involved in matrix operations that could affect the calculations in the density methods. If the matrix multiplication is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect density calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getDeterminant method calculates the determinant of a matrix, which may be used in the density calculations.

While important, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure compared to the density calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getRealEigenvalues method simply returns a clone of the real eigenvalues. This method is less likely to be the source of the issue since it does not perform any calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
