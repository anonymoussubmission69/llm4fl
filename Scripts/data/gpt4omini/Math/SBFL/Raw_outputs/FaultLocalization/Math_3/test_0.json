The test case is failing due to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, which suggests that the method is trying to access an index that does not exist in one of the arrays. The test case provides arrays of length 1, but the method seems to be accessing indices beyond this length, particularly in the second for loop where it starts from index 1 and goes to len - 1. This indicates a potential off-by-one error or a lack of proper boundary checks.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
