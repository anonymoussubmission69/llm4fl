However, the implementation has a logical flaw in the handling of cases where either u or v is zero. The return statement for the case when u * v == 0 is incorrect, as it returns the sum of the absolute values instead of the correct gcd value. This could lead to incorrect results, as evidenced by the test failure where the expected gcd was 98304 but the actual result was 3440640.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
