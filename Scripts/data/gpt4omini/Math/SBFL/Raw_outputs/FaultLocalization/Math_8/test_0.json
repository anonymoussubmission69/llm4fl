"Based on the analysis of the test and the stack trace, the test `testIssue942` is attempting to sample from a `DiscreteDistribution` created with a list of pairs, but it encounters an `ArrayStoreException`. This suggests that there is an issue with the types being handled in the `DiscreteDistribution` class, particularly in the `sample` method.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The sample method attempts to create an array of type T, which is derived from the singletons list. If the singletons list contains incompatible types, it could lead to an ArrayStoreException when trying to store elements in the array. This method is directly involved in the sampling process that caused the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The sample method retrieves a random value and selects an element based on probabilities. If the probabilities are not set correctly or if the singletons list is not compatible with the expected type, it could lead to issues when trying to return a value. This method is also directly related to the sampling process.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor initializes the DiscreteDistribution with a list of samples. If the samples are not correctly formed or if the types are incompatible, it could lead to issues later in the sampling process. However, it is less suspicious than the sample methods since it is not directly involved in the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This constructor initializes a DiscreteRealDistribution and checks the lengths of singletons and probabilities. If they are mismatched, it could lead to issues, but it is less likely to cause an ArrayStoreException directly compared to the sample methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method normalizes an array of values. While it could potentially lead to issues if the values are not handled correctly, it is the least related to the immediate problem of sampling and the ArrayStoreException. It does not directly interact with the sampling process.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
