"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testExtremeValues` is designed to check the behavior of the `NormalDistribution` class when extreme values are used. The stack trace indicates that a `MaxIterationsExceededException` is thrown, which suggests that the method responsible for calculating probabilities is not converging within the allowed iterations.\n\n2. The methods involved in the stack trace are:\n   - `cumulativeProbability` (method_id: 2)\n   - `erf` (method_id: 3)\n   - `regularizedGammaP` (method_id: 10)\n\n3. The method `setStandardDeviation` (method_id: 6) is also included, but it does not seem directly related to the exception since it only sets the standard deviation and does not perform any calculations.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method regularizedGammaP is responsible for calculating the regularized gamma function, which is called by erf.
