"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `testSSENonNegative` is designed to ensure that the sum of squared errors (SSE) calculated by the `SimpleRegression` class is non-negative. The assertion failure indicates that the calculated SSE is negative, which is not expected.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods:\n\n1. **Method 0: `SimpleRegression()`**\n   - This is the constructor for the `SimpleRegression` class. It initializes the object but does not perform any calculations or data handling. While it is essential for setting up the object, it does not directly contribute to the failure of the test.\n\n2. **Method 1: `addData(double x, double y)`**\n   - This method adds data points to the regression model. It updates several internal state variables (`xbar`, `ybar`, `sumXX`, `sumYY`, `sumXY`, `sumX`, `sumY`, and `n`). The logic here is crucial because if the data is not added correctly, it could lead to incorrect calculations in subsequent methods. The handling of the sums and averages appears to be complex, and any mistake in the logic could lead to incorrect SSE calculations.\n\n3. **Method 2: `getSumSquaredErrors()`**\n   - This method calculates the sum of squared errors using the formula `sumYY - sumXY * sumXY / sumXX`. If `sumXX` is zero or if `sumYY` and `sumXY` are not updated correctly in `addData`, this could lead to a negative result. Given that the test is failing due to a negative SSE, this method is highly suspicious.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\nBased on the analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getSumSquaredErrors method calculates the SSE. If the internal state variables (sumYY, sumXY, sumXX) are not correctly updated, it can lead to a negative SSE, which is the cause of the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The addData method is responsible for updating the internal state variables used in the SSE calculation. If there is a logical error in how data is added or how the sums are calculated, it could lead to incorrect values in getSumSquaredErrors.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor initializes the SimpleRegression object but does not contribute to the calculation of SSE. It is not directly related to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
