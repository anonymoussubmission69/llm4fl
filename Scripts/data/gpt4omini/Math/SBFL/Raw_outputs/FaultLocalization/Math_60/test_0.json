"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testExtremeValues` is designed to check the behavior of the `cumulativeProbability` method of a `NormalDistribution` implementation when given extreme values. The stack trace indicates that a `ConvergenceException` is thrown due to a continued fraction diverging to NaN for the value of infinity. This suggests that the issue lies within the methods involved in calculating the cumulative probability, particularly those that handle extreme values.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The cumulativeProbability method is directly involved in the test that fails. It calls the Erf.erf method, which is likely where the divergence occurs when handling extreme values.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The erf method is called by cumulativeProbability and is responsible for calculating the error function, which is critical in determining the cumulative probability. If it fails to handle extreme values correctly, it could lead to the observed exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The evaluate method of the ContinuedFraction class is involved in the calculation of probabilities and could be responsible for the divergence when handling large values, as indicated by the stack trace.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The regularizedGammaQ method is part of the calculations that could be indirectly related to the cumulative probability calculations. However, it is less directly involved than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The logGamma method is used in the calculations but is less likely to be the direct cause of the convergence issue since it deals with logarithmic calculations rather than the direct evaluation of probabilities.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The ConvergenceException constructor is not related to the logic of probability calculations and is simply a part of the exception handling mechanism. It is the least suspicious in terms of causing the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
