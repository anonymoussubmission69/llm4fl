"Based on the analysis of the test failure and the method bodies retrieved, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'isSupportLowerBoundInclusive' always returns true, which contradicts the test expectation that it should return false. This is the most suspicious method as it directly relates to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getSupportLowerBound' returns 0, which may not align with the expected behavior of the support lower bound being inclusive. This could potentially contribute to the test failure if the expected value is not 0.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'density' method is incomplete and may contain logical errors that could affect the calculations related to the distribution. However, it is less directly related to the test failure than methods 0 and 3.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'logBeta' method is a utility function that is less likely to be the cause of the test failure. It is a static method that computes a logarithmic value and does not directly relate to the test case.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor for 'FDistribution' is not fully visible, but constructors typically initialize state rather than directly affecting test outcomes. It is less suspicious without further context.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Similar to method 4, this constructor initializes an instance of 'FDistribution' and does not directly relate to the test failure. It is the least suspicious method.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
