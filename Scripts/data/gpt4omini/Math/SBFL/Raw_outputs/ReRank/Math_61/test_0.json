"Based on the analysis of the test case and the retrieved method bodies, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method ID 1**: This method is responsible for initializing the `PoissonDistributionImpl` with a mean value `p`. It correctly checks if `p` is less than or equal to zero and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. The test case is failing because it attempts to create a `PoissonDistributionImpl` with a negative mean (-1), which should trigger this exception. Therefore, this method remains highly suspicious as it directly relates to the test failure.\n\n2. **Method ID 0**: This constructor calls another constructor (method_id 1) with default values. It does not perform any checks on the mean value `p` itself, but it relies on method_id 1 to handle the validation. While it is not directly responsible for the failure, it allows the creation of an instance with an invalid mean without any checks. This method is still suspicious but less so than method_id 1.\n\n3. **Method ID 7**: This method is a utility method for creating an `IllegalArgumentException`. It does not directly relate to the test case or the handling of the mean value. It is not suspicious in the context of the test failure since it does not contribute to the logic that checks the validity of the mean value.\n\n### Proposed Fixes:\n- **Method ID 1**: No changes are needed as it already handles the validation correctly. However, ensure that the exception message is clear and informative.\n  \n- **Method ID 0**: Consider adding a validation check in this constructor to prevent the creation of an instance with an invalid mean. For example:\n  ```java\n  public PoissonDistributionImpl(double p) {\n      if (p <= 0) {\n          throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Mean must be positive\");\n      }\n      this(p, DEFAULT_EPSILON, DEFAULT_MAX_ITERATIONS);\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Method ID 7**: No changes are needed as it does not affect the test case.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 1**: Rank 1 (most suspicious)\n2. **Method ID 0**: Rank 2 (less suspicious but still relevant)\n3. **Method ID 7**: Rank 3 (least suspicious)\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
