    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method 18 and Method 20**: Both methods `inverseCumulativeProbability` are identical and directly related to the failing test. The test fails when asserting that the result is less than 1.0, indicating potential issues with how edge cases (like when `p` is close to 0 or 1) are handled. The logic in these methods needs to ensure that the calculations for `upperBound` and `lowerBound` are correctly implemented, especially when `p` is at the extremes.\n\n2. **Method 3 (`getNumericalVariance`)**: This method calculates the variance, which is critical for the calculations in `inverseCumulativeProbability`. If the variance is incorrectly calculated, it could lead to incorrect results in the probability calculation.\n\n3. **Method 2 (`getNumericalMean`)**: Similar to variance, the mean is also crucial for the calculations in `inverseCumulativeProbability`. If the mean is calculated incorrectly, it could affect the results of the probability calculations.\n\n4. **Method 5 (`getSupportLowerBound`)**: This method returns a constant value of 0. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure, it could still play a role in the overall calculations if the bounds are not set correctly.\n\n5. **Method 6 (`getSupportUpperBound`)**: This method returns `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, which is standard and does not involve calculations that could lead to inaccuracies in the probability results. Therefore, it is the least suspicious.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **For Methods 18 and 20**: Ensure that the handling of edge cases for `p` values of 0 and 1 is robust. Specifically, check the logic that determines the `upperBound` and `lowerBound` and ensure that the calculations do not lead to invalid results. Consider adding checks or adjustments for cases where `p` is very close to 0 or 1.\n\n- **For Method 3**: Review the implementation of `calculateNumericalVariance()` to ensure that it correctly computes the variance based on the data set being used.\n\n- **For Method 2**: Review the logic in `getNumericalMean()` to ensure that it correctly calculates the mean, especially for edge cases in the degrees of freedom.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
