    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 10: `regularizedGammaP`**\n   - **Issue**: The method is throwing a `MaxIterationsExceededException`, indicating that the series is not converging within the maximum number of iterations. This could be due to inappropriate values of `a` or `x`.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add checks to ensure that the parameters `a` and `x` are within a valid range before proceeding with the calculations. Additionally, consider implementing a fallback mechanism or a different algorithm for cases where convergence is not achieved.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 1.\n\n2. **Method ID 3: `erf`**\n   - **Issue**: This method directly calls `regularizedGammaP`, which is failing. If `regularizedGammaP` does not return a valid result, `erf` will also fail.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Implement error handling to catch exceptions from `regularizedGammaP` and return a default value or throw a more informative exception.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 2.\n\n3. **Method ID 2: `cumulativeProbability`**\n   - **Issue**: This method relies on `erf`, which in turn relies on `regularizedGammaP`. It does not perform calculations that could lead to the exception directly.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add error handling to catch exceptions from `erf` and return a default value or throw a more informative exception.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 3.\n\n4. **Method ID 6: `setStandardDeviation`**\n   - **Issue**: This method simply sets a value and does not contribute to the calculations that lead to the exception.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes needed as it does not affect the calculations.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 4.\n\nBased on the analysis, the ranking remains the same. Here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
