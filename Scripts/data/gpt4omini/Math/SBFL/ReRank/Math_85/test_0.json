    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test case and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test case fails due to a `ConvergenceException`, which indicates that the method `inverseCumulativeProbability` is likely not handling edge cases or iterations correctly. This method is directly involved in the test case, making it the most suspicious.\n\n2. The `cumulativeProbability` method is called within `inverseCumulativeProbability`. If it does not handle extreme values properly, it could lead to convergence issues, making it the second most suspicious.\n\n3. The `getDomainLowerBound` and `getDomainUpperBound` methods are responsible for determining the bounds for the probability calculations. If they return incorrect bounds, it could affect the calculations in `inverseCumulativeProbability`, making them equally suspicious but less so than the first two methods.\n\n4. The `bracket` methods are responsible for finding a range where the function changes sign. While they could contribute to convergence issues, they are less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- **Method 3 (`inverseCumulativeProbability`)**: Ensure that the method handles edge cases for `p` values of 0 and 1 correctly. Implement additional checks for convergence criteria and possibly increase the maximum number of iterations or adjust the convergence logic.\n\n- **Method 7 (`cumulativeProbability`)**: Add checks for extreme values of `x` to ensure that the method does not return values that could lead to convergence issues. Consider refining the logic for handling values outside the mean \u00b1 20 * standard deviation.\n\n- **Method 0 (`getDomainLowerBound`)**: Ensure that the method correctly calculates the lower bound for all possible values of `p`. It may need to handle cases where `p` is very close to 0.\n\n- **Method 1 (`getDomainUpperBound`)**: Similar to the lower bound method, ensure that it correctly calculates the upper bound for all possible values of `p`, especially for values close to 0.5.\n\n- **Method 12 and Method 11 (`bracket`)**: Review the logic for determining the initial values and bounds. Ensure that the method can handle cases where the initial guess is outside the bounds.\n\n### ReRanked Methods:\nBased on the analysis and potential fixes, the re-ranked list of methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
