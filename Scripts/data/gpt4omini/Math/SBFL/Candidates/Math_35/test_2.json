    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testConstructorTooLow` is designed to check if an exception is thrown when a negative elitism rate is passed to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor. The expected exception is `OutOfRangeException`, which indicates that the input value is outside the acceptable range.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `ListPopulation` constructor, which checks if the population limit is less than or equal to zero.\n2. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor, which calls the `ListPopulation` constructor and sets the elitism rate.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`ListPopulation` constructor**: This method checks the population limit but does not throw an exception if the limit is less than or equal to zero. This could be a potential issue if the constructor is expected to enforce a valid range.\n2. **`ElitisticListPopulation` constructor**: This method does not validate the elitism rate, which is critical since the test is designed to check for negative values.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth constructors are suspicious because they do not handle invalid input properly, which leads to the failure of the test. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
