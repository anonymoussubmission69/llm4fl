    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testConstructorTooHigh` is designed to check the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` for handling an invalid elitism rate. The expected exception is `OutOfRangeException`, which indicates that the elitism rate provided (1.25) is outside the acceptable range.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the test fails because the expected exception is not thrown, suggesting that the constructor does not properly validate the elitism rate.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `ListPopulation` constructor which checks the population limit.\n2. `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor which calls the `ListPopulation` constructor and sets the elitism rate.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`ListPopulation:<init>(I)V`** - This method initializes the population limit and may not be directly related to the elitism rate validation but is part of the constructor chain.\n2. **`ElitisticListPopulation:<init>(ID)V`** - This method is directly responsible for setting the elitism rate and is where the validation for the elitism rate should occur.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious, but the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor is the primary focus since it is responsible for handling the elitism rate. The `ListPopulation` constructor is also relevant as it may affect the overall population initialization.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
