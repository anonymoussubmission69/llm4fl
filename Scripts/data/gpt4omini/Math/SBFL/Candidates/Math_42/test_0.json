The test `testMath713NegativeVariable` is designed to test the optimization of a linear objective function using the `SimplexSolver`. The test fails at the assertion that checks if the solution's points are non-negative.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `assertTrue` method, which suggests that the computed solution from the `SimplexSolver` does not meet the expected criteria (i.e., the points are not non-negative).\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include various methods from the `SimplexSolver`, `SimplexTableau`, and `LinearObjectiveFunction` classes, which are all involved in the optimization process.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`getValue(double[] point)`**: This method computes the value of the objective function at a given point. If it returns incorrect values, it could lead to incorrect optimization results.\n- **`getSolution()`**: This method retrieves the solution from the tableau. If the solution is not computed correctly, it will directly affect the test outcome.\n- **`doIteration(SimplexTableau tableau)`**: This method performs an iteration of the Simplex algorithm. Any issues in this method could lead to incorrect optimization steps.\n- **`getPivotColumn(SimplexTableau tableau)`** and **`getPivotRow(SimplexTableau tableau, int col)`**: These methods determine the pivot column and row, which are critical for the Simplex algorithm's operation. Errors here could lead to incorrect iterations.\n- **`isOptimal()`**: This method checks if the current tableau is optimal. If it incorrectly determines that the solution is optimal when it is not, it could lead to a failure in the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 5, 3, 4, 20]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the test failure."
