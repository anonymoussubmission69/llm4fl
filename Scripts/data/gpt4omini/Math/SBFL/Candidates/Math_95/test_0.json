The test `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` is attempting to calculate the cumulative probability and then the inverse cumulative probability using the `FDistributionImpl` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to invalid endpoint parameters, specifically mentioning `lowerBound=0.0` and `initial=-1.0`.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `inverseCumulativeProbability` from `FDistributionImpl`\n   - `bracket` from `UnivariateRealSolverUtils`\n   - `bracket` from `AbstractContinuousDistribution`\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`inverseCumulativeProbability` (method_id: 3)**: This method is directly involved in the test and is where the exception is thrown. It needs to be checked for how it handles the input values and whether it correctly validates them.\n  \n- **`bracket` (method_id: 11)**: This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and is responsible for determining the bounds for the root-finding algorithm. The parameters passed to it should be validated to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.\n\n- **`getDomainLowerBound` (method_id: 0)** and **`getDomainUpperBound` (method_id: 1)**: These methods provide the bounds for the distribution. If they return incorrect values, it could lead to the invalid parameters seen in the exception.\n\n- **`getInitialDomain` (method_id: 2)**: This method calculates the initial domain based on the degrees of freedom. If the degrees of freedom are not set correctly, it could lead to an invalid initial value.\n\n- **`setNumeratorDegreesOfFreedom` (method_id: 8)** and **`setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` (method_id: 9)**: These methods set the degrees of freedom for the distribution. If they are not called with valid values, it could lead to issues in the calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 11, 0, 1, 2, 8, 9]\n}\n```"
