    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` is designed to check the parsing of a string representation of a fraction. The test expects a `ParseException` to be thrown when an invalid input is provided. However, the test fails because the exception is not thrown, indicating that there may be an issue in the parsing logic.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the `FractionFormatTest` class, specifically in the `testParseProperInvalidMinus` method. The relevant methods that are covered by this test and may be suspicious include:\n\n1. **`FractionFormat:parse(String source)`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input string and is likely where the failure occurs if the input is not handled correctly.\n2. **`FractionFormat:parse(String source, ParsePosition pos)`** - This method is called by the previous method and handles the actual parsing logic. If there is an issue with how it processes the input, it could lead to the failure.\n3. **`FractionFormat:parseAndIgnoreWhitespace(String source, ParsePosition pos)`** - This method is used to ignore whitespace in the input string. If it does not handle the input correctly, it could affect the parsing outcome.\n4. **`FractionFormat:parseNextCharacter(String source, ParsePosition pos)`** - This method retrieves the next character from the input string. If it does not correctly identify characters, it could lead to parsing errors.\n5. **`ProperFractionFormat:parse(String source, ParsePosition pos)`** - This method extends the parsing functionality and may also be involved in the parsing logic, especially if the input is expected to be in a specific format.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the parsing process and could potentially contain the fault that leads to the test failure."
