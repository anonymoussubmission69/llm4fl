    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testDigitLimitConstructor` is designed to test the `BigFraction` class, specifically its constructor that takes a double value and a maximum denominator.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `FractionConversionException` was thrown due to an overflow while trying to convert a double to a fraction.\n3. The exception was thrown from the `BigFraction` constructor, which suggests that the issue lies within the logic of this constructor or the methods it calls.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to the failure include:\n\n- `BigFraction.<init>(DI)V` (method_id: 1): This is the constructor that is directly involved in the test and is likely where the overflow occurs.\n- `BigFraction.<init>(DDII)V` (method_id: 3): This private constructor is also called within the public constructor and contains logic that could lead to the overflow.\n- `FractionConversionException.<init>(DJJ)V` (method_id: 0): This method is responsible for throwing the exception, and while it doesn't contain the fault, it is relevant to the error handling.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. `BigFraction.<init>(DI)V` (method_id: 1)\n2. `BigFraction.<init>(DDII)V` (method_id: 3)\n3. `FractionConversionException.<init>(DJJ)V` (method_id: 0)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3]\n}\n```"
