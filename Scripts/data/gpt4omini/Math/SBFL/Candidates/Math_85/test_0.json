This indicates that the method responsible for calculating the inverse cumulative probability is not converging within the allowed iterations. \n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`inverseCumulativeProbability(D)`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is where the failure occurs.\n2. **`getDomainLowerBound(D)`** - This method is called within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method and could affect the bounds used for calculations.\n3. **`getDomainUpperBound(D)`** - Similar to the lower bound, this method is also called within `inverseCumulativeProbability` and could impact the convergence.\n4. **`cumulativeProbability(D)`** - This method is used in the root-finding function within `inverseCumulativeProbability`, and any issues here could lead to convergence problems.\n5. **`bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDD)`** - This method is responsible for finding the initial bracket for the root-finding algorithm, which is critical for convergence.\n6. **`bracket(Lorg/apache/commons/math/analysis/UnivariateRealFunction;DDDI)`** - This overloaded method also deals with bracketing and could be relevant to the convergence issue.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 0, 1, 7, 11, 12]\n}\n```"
