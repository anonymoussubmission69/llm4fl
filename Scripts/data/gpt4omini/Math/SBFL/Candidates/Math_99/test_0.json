    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testLcm()` is designed to test the `lcm(int a, int b)` method from the `MathUtils` class. The test is failing because it expects an `ArithmeticException` when calling `MathUtils.lcm(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 1)`, but it does not receive this exception.\n\n2. The `lcm` method calls the `gcd(int p, int q)` method, which is also covered in the test. The `gcd` method has a complex implementation that could potentially lead to issues, especially with edge cases involving negative numbers or zero.\n\n3. The `mulAndCheck(int x, int y)` method is also covered in the test. This method checks for overflow when multiplying two integers, which is crucial for the correct functioning of the `lcm` method.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `MathUtils.lcm(int a, int b)` (method_id: 0)\n- `MathUtils.gcd(int p, int q)` (method_id: 1)\n- `MathUtils.mulAndCheck(int x, int y)` (method_id: 2)\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the computation of the least common multiple and could be the source of the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
