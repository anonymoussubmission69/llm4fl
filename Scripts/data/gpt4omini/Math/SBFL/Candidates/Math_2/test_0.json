The stack trace indicates that the sample value was -50, which is outside the expected range of 0 to n (where n is 50). \n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and could potentially lead to this fault include:\n\n1. **`getNumericalMean()`**: This method calculates the mean of the distribution, which could affect the sampling behavior.\n2. **`getNumericalVariance()`**: Variance is crucial for understanding the spread of the distribution, which could influence the sampling.\n3. **`calculateNumericalVariance()`**: This method is responsible for calculating the variance and could be a source of error if the calculations are incorrect.\n4. **`getSupportLowerBound()`**: This method determines the lower bound of the support for the distribution, which is critical since the sample should not be less than this value.\n5. **`getSupportUpperBound()`**: This method determines the upper bound of the support for the distribution, which is also critical for validating the sample.\n6. **`sample()`**: This method is directly responsible for generating the sample value, and any issues here would directly lead to incorrect samples.\n7. **`inverseCumulativeProbability()`**: This method is involved in determining the sample based on a probability value, and any issues in its logic could lead to invalid samples.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 12]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
