The test `testMath864` is failing due to an assertion that checks if the result of the optimization is within the upper bounds. The failure message indicates that the result exceeded the upper limit of `0.5`, returning `0.5246031767455861`.\n\n2. The test involves the `CMAESOptimizer` class, specifically the `optimize` method, which is responsible for performing the optimization. The parameters passed to this method include a fitness function and bounds for the optimization.\n\n3. The methods that are likely to be suspicious and need further analysis include:\n   - The constructor of `CMAESOptimizer` and its initialization methods, as they set up the optimizer's parameters.\n   - The `optimize` method itself, which contains the logic for the optimization process.\n   - The `value` method of the `FitnessFunction`, which computes the fitness value and may influence the optimization outcome.\n   - The methods related to boundary checks and repairs, such as `repair`, `penalty`, and any methods that handle the boundaries of the optimization.\n\nBased on the covered methods by the failed test, the following method IDs are identified as suspicious:\n\n- `CMAESOptimizer:<init>()` (ID: 0)\n- `CMAESOptimizer:<init>(I)` (ID: 1)\n- `CMAESOptimizer:optimize(10000, fitnessFunction, GoalType.MINIMIZE, start, lower, upper)` (ID: 50)\n- `CMAESOptimizer$FitnessFunction:value([D)D` (ID: 36)\n- `CMAESOptimizer$FitnessFunction:repair([D)[D` (ID: 34)\n- `CMAESOptimizer$FitnessFunction:penalty([D[D)D` (ID: 3)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 34, 36, 50]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
