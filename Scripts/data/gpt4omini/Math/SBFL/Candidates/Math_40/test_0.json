The test `testIssue716` is designed to test the `BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver` class, specifically its `solve` method.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `TooManyEvaluationsException` was thrown, which suggests that the maximum evaluation count was exceeded during the execution of the `solve` method.\n3. The `solve` method is called with a maximum evaluation count of 100, and it appears that the solver is unable to find a solution within this limit, leading to the exception.\n\nThe methods that are potentially suspicious and need to be analyzed further include:\n\n1. **`BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver:solve(...)`** - This is the main method being tested and is directly related to the failure.\n2. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:incrementEvaluationCount()`** - This method is responsible for incrementing the evaluation count and throwing the exception if the maximum count is exceeded.\n3. **`BaseAbstractUnivariateRealSolver:computeObjectiveValue(double)`** - This method is called to compute the objective value and increments the evaluation count.\n4. **`BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver:doSolve()`** - This method is part of the solving process and may contain logic that leads to excessive evaluations.\n5. **`Incrementor:incrementCount()`** - This method is involved in managing the count of evaluations and triggering the exception.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 22, 21, 9, 29]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to understand why the maximum evaluation count is being exceeded and to identify any potential faults in the logic of the solver."
