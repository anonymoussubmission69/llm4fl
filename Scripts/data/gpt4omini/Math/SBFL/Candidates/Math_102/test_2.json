    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testChiSquareLargeTestStatistic` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected chi-square test statistic does not match the actual value returned by the method. The relevant methods involved in this computation are primarily from the `ChiSquareTestImpl` class and its interactions with the `ChiSquaredDistributionImpl` and `GammaDistributionImpl` classes.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`chiSquareTest(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is directly involved in calculating the chi-square test statistic and is the primary method being tested.\n2. **`chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)`** - This method is called within `chiSquareTest` to compute the chi-square statistic.\n3. **`cumulativeProbability(double x)`** - This method is called within `chiSquareTest` to compute the cumulative probability, which is essential for determining the p-value.\n4. **`getGamma()`** - This method retrieves the gamma distribution used in the calculations, which could affect the results if not set correctly.\n5. **`setDegreesOfFreedom(double degreesOfFreedom)`** - This method sets the degrees of freedom for the chi-squared distribution, which is critical for accurate statistical calculations.\n6. **`isPositive(double[] in)`** - This method checks if the expected values are positive, which is a prerequisite for the chi-square test.\n7. **`isNonNegative(long[] in)`** - This method checks if the observed values are non-negative, which is also a prerequisite for the chi-square test.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and any issues in their logic or data handling could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 6, 1, 14, 16, 7, 8]\n}\n```"
