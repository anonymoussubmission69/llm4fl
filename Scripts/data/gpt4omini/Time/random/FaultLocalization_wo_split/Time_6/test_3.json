    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date after adding years is not matching the actual date returned by the `plusYears` method. The expected date is `-0002-06-30`, but the actual result is `-0001-06-30`.
