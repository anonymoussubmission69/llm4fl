    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testWith_baseAndArgHaveNoRange` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` indicating that the types array must not contain duplicates. This suggests that there is a problem with how types are being added or validated in the `Partial` class.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the constructor of the `Partial` class and the `with` method, indicating that the issue likely originates from how these methods handle the `DateTimeFieldType` objects.\n\n3. The methods will be ranked based on their involvement in the creation and validation of `Partial` objects, particularly focusing on how they manage the `DateTimeFieldType` array.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of the Partial class is responsible for initializing the types and values.
