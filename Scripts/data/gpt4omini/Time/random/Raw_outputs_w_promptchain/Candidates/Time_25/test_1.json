"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `test_getOffsetFromLocal_Moscow_Autumn` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` indicating that the expected offset for a specific time in Moscow is `+04:00`, but the actual result returned is `+03:00`. This suggests that there is an issue with how the offset is being calculated for the given date and time.\n\n2. The method `getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal)` is directly involved in the offset calculation, and it is likely where the fault originates. This method calls other methods to determine the offset, including `getOffset(long instant)` and potentially methods related to transitions and adjustments.\n\n3. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `doTest_getOffsetFromLocal` method, which is likely a wrapper or helper method that calls `getOffsetFromLocal`.\n\n4. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to date and time calculations, particularly those that deal with chronology and offsets.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are identified as suspicious and warrant further analysis:\n\n- `getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal)` (method_id: 3)\n- `getOffset(long instant)` (method_id: 6)\n- `nextTransition(long instant)` (method_id: 12)\n- `getYear(long instant)` (method_id: 1)\n- `getMonthOfYear(long millis)` (method_id: 38)\n- `getDayOfMonth(long millis, int year)` (method_id: 90)\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 6, 12, 1, 38, 90]\n}\n```"
