"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `test_getOffsetFromLocal_Moscow_Autumn_overlap_mins` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` indicating that the expected offset for the date `2007-10-28T02:00:00.000+04:00` was not met, as it returned `2007-10-28T02:00:00.000+03:00`. This suggests that there is an issue with how the time zone offset is being calculated, particularly around the transition from daylight saving time.\n\nThe stack trace points to the method `doTest_getOffsetFromLocal` in the `TestDateTimeZoneCutover` class, which is likely responsible for testing the offset calculation. The methods covered by the failed test include various methods related to date and time calculations, particularly those that deal with time zones and offsets.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.tz.CachedDateTimeZone:getOffset(J)I`** - This method is responsible for getting the offset for a given instant, which is directly related to the failure.\n2. **`org.joda.time.tz.CachedDateTimeZone:getInfo(J)Lorg/joda/time/tz/CachedDateTimeZone$Info;`** - This method retrieves information about the time zone, which may include rules for daylight saving time.\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getYear(J)I`** - This method calculates the year from a given instant, which may affect how offsets are determined.\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getMonthOfYear(J)I`** - This method calculates the month of the year from a given instant, which is also relevant for determining offsets.\n5. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDayOfMonth(JII)I`** - This method calculates the day of the month, which is important for understanding the context of the date in question.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, especially in the context of calculating time zone offsets during transitions.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 53, 1, 27, 9]\n}\n```"
