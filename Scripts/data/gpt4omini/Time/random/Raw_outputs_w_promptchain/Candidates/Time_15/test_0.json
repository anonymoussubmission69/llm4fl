"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSafeMultiplyLongInt` is designed to validate the behavior of the `FieldUtils.safeMultiply` method. The test is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, which indicates that the expected result does not match the actual result returned by the method.\n\nThe only covered method by the failed test is `FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long val1, int val2)`. This method is responsible for multiplying a long value by an integer and includes a check for overflow. The suspicious parts of the method include the handling of different cases for `val2`, as well as the overflow check.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n``` \n\nThis indicates that the `safeMultiply` method is the primary suspect for the fault, and further analysis should focus on its implementation and the specific cases being tested."
