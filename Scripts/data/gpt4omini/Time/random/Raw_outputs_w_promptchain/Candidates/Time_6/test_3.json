"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date `-0002-06-30` does not match the actual result `-0001-06-30` when calling `date.plusYears(-2004)`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the method responsible for calculating the year when a negative value is added to a date, particularly around the cutover point between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.LocalDate:plusYears(I)Lorg/joda/time/LocalDate;` (method_id: 76)** - This method is directly involved in adding years to a `LocalDate` instance, which is the core of the failing test.\n\n2. **`org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology:getDateTimeMillis(IIII)J` (method_id: 53)** - This method is responsible for converting the year, month, and day into milliseconds, which is crucial for date calculations.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology:gregorianToJulianByYear(J)J` (method_id: 52)** - This method handles the conversion from Gregorian to Julian dates, which is relevant given the test's context of crossing the cutover.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getYear(J)I` (method_id: 2)** - This method retrieves the year from a given instant, which is important for understanding how years are calculated.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getYearMonthDayMillis(III)J` (method_id: 77)** - This method calculates the milliseconds for a specific year, month, and day, which is also relevant to the date calculations.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicGJChronology:setYear(JI)J` (method_id: 79)** - This method sets the year for a given instant, which may be involved in the logic that leads to the incorrect year being returned.\n\n7. **`org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology$CutoverField:roundFloor(J)J` (method_id: 65)** - This method may be involved in rounding down to the nearest valid date, which could affect the outcome when crossing the cutover.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [76, 53, 52, 2, 77, 79, 65]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
