"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testWith_baseAndArgHaveNoRange` is attempting to create a `Partial` object with a year and then call the `with` method to add an era. The assertion checks if the size of the resulting `Partial` is 2.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to duplicate types in the `Partial` constructor. Specifically, the error message states: \"Types array must not contain duplicate: era and year\".\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace are:\n   - `org.joda.time.Partial.<init>(Partial.java:224)` - This is the constructor for the `Partial` class.\n   - `org.joda.time.Partial.with(Partial.java:466)` - This is the method being called to add a new field to the `Partial`.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are relevant to the fault:\n\n- `org.joda.time.Partial:with(Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType;I)Lorg/joda/time/Partial;` (method_id: 7) - This method is responsible for adding a new field to the `Partial` and is directly involved in the test.\n- `org.joda.time.Partial:<init>([Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType;[ILorg/joda/time/Chronology;)V` (method_id: 15) - This constructor is called when creating a new `Partial` and is likely where the duplicate type check occurs.\n- `org.joda.time.Partial:size()I` (method_id: 0) - This method is called to get the size of the `Partial`, which is part of the assertion in the test.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be further investigated:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 7, 15]\n}\n```"
