"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMinusMonths_int_endOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of subtracting one month from March 31 is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `minusMonths` method handles month-end dates, particularly in leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:minusMonths(I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (Method ID: 43)** - This is the method directly involved in the test case. It is responsible for subtracting months from a `MonthDay` instance.\n\n2. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:withFieldAdded(Lorg/joda/time/DurationFieldType;I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (Method ID: 95)** - This method is called within `minusMonths` and is responsible for adding or subtracting a field value, which could affect the month calculation.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField:getMaximumValue(Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePartial;[I)I` (Method ID: 89)** - This method determines the maximum value for a given month, which is crucial for validating the day of the month when subtracting months.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField:getMinimumValue()I` (Method ID: 17)** - This method returns the minimum value for the month, which could also affect the calculations when adjusting the month.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDaysInMonthMax(I)I` (Method ID: 56)** - This method returns the maximum number of days in a given month, which is essential for determining the correct day when adjusting months.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDayOfMonth(JI)I` (Method ID: 61)** - This method retrieves the day of the month for a given date, which is relevant when calculating the new date after subtracting months.\n\n7. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDaysInYearMonth(II)I` (Method ID: 85)** - This method returns the number of days in a specific year and month, which is important for leap year calculations.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [43, 95, 89, 17, 56, 61, 85]\n}\n```"
