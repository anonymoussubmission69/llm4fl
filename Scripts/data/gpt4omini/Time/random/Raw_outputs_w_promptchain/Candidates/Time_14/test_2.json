"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testPlusMonths_int_negativeFromLeap` is designed to test the `plusMonths` method of the `MonthDay` class, specifically when a negative month is added to a leap day (February 29).\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalFieldValueException` is thrown due to an invalid day of the month (29) for the month of January, which only has 28 days in non-leap years.\n3. The exception is triggered in the `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds` method, which checks if the day value is within the valid range for the month.\n4. The `plusMonths` method calls `withFieldAdded`, which in turn relies on the `getField` method to retrieve the appropriate field type for months.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`plusMonths(int months)`**: This method is directly involved in the test case and is responsible for adding months to the `MonthDay` instance.\n- **`withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`**: This method is called by `plusMonths` and is responsible for adding the specified field type (months in this case).\n- **`FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds(DateTimeField field, int value, int lowerBound, int upperBound)`**: This method is responsible for validating the day value and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`getDaysInMonthMax()`**: This method is used to determine the maximum number of days in a month, which is crucial for validating the day value.\n- **`getMinimumValue()`**: This method is used to get the minimum valid day value, which is also important for validation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 49, 52, 32, 8]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to understand the root cause of the failure in the test case."
