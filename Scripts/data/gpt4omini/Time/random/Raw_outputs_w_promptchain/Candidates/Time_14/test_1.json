"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testPlusMonths_int_negativeEndOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of adding a negative month to a `MonthDay` object representing March 31 is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `plusMonths` method handles month-end adjustments, particularly in leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:plusMonths(I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (method_id: 27)** - This is the method directly involved in the test case. It adds months to a `MonthDay` instance and is likely where the fault originates.\n\n2. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:withFieldAdded(Lorg/joda/time/DurationFieldType;I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (method_id: 94)** - This method is called by `plusMonths` to perform the actual addition of months. It may contain logic that incorrectly handles month-end adjustments.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField:add(JI)J` (method_id: 93)** - This method is responsible for adding months to a date and may have logic that does not correctly account for the number of days in the resulting month, especially when transitioning from a month with 31 days to one with fewer days.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDaysInMonthMax(I)I` (method_id: 55)** - This method returns the maximum number of days in a given month. If it returns an incorrect value for February in a leap year, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDayOfMonth(JI)I` (method_id: 60)** - This method retrieves the day of the month for a given date. If it does not correctly handle the transition from one month to another, it could also contribute to the issue.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:<init>(IILorg/joda/time/Chronology;)V` (method_id: 17)** - The constructor for `MonthDay` initializes the object. If the initialization logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect state being set for the `MonthDay` instance.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [27, 94, 93, 55, 60, 17]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test case."
