The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months2` is designed to test the `normalizedStandard` method of the `Period` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the `setIndexedField` method of the `PeriodType` class, which is called during the execution of the `normalizedStandard` method.\n3. The `normalizedStandard` method attempts to set indexed fields using the `PeriodType`, which leads to the exception when a field is not supported.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`setIndexedField` (method_id: 22)**: This method is directly responsible for throwing the `UnsupportedOperationException`. It checks if a field is supported and throws an exception if it is not.\n- **`normalizedStandard` (method_id: 14)**: This method is where the exception originates, as it calls `setIndexedField`.\n- **`getIndexedField` (method_id: 43)**: This method is called within `setIndexedField` and retrieves the value of a field based on its index. If the index is invalid, it could lead to issues.\n- **`getPeriodType` (method_id: 15)**: This method is used to retrieve the `PeriodType`, which is essential for the operations in `normalizedStandard`.\n- **`withYears` (method_id: 40)**: This method is called within `normalizedStandard` and may also contribute to the issue if it interacts with unsupported fields.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 22, 43, 15, 40]\n}\n```"
