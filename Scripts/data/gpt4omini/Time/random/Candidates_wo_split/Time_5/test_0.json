The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_monthsWeeks` is designed to test the `normalizedStandard` method of the `Period` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the `setIndexedField` method of the `PeriodType` class, which suggests that the field being accessed is not supported.\n3. The `normalizedStandard` method calls `getMillis()` and then attempts to create a new `Period` object, which may involve several other methods that could also be contributing to the issue.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 22**: `normalizedStandard(PeriodType type)` - This is the method being tested and is directly involved in the failure.\n- **Method ID 34**: `setIndexedField(ReadablePeriod period, int index, int[] values, int newValue)` - This method is where the exception is thrown, indicating that it is critical to understanding the fault.\n- **Method ID 63**: `getIndexedField(ReadablePeriod period, int index)` - This method is called within `setIndexedField` and may also be relevant to the issue.\n- **Method ID 35**: `getYears()` - This method is called within `normalizedStandard` and may contribute to the state of the `Period`.\n- **Method ID 26**: `getMonths()` - Similar to `getYears()`, this method is also called within `normalizedStandard` and could affect the outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [22, 34, 63, 35, 26]\n}\n```"
