"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date after adding years is not matching the actual date returned. The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `plusYears` method when crossing a cutover point in the calendar system.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'plusYears' method is directly involved in the test case. It is responsible for adding years to a date, and the failure indicates that it may not be handling the transition correctly, especially around cutover points.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 53,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getDateTimeMillis' method is crucial for converting a date to milliseconds. If it does not correctly handle the cutover logic, it could lead to incorrect results in 'plusYears'.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getYearMonthDayMillis' method is involved in calculating the milliseconds for a specific date. If it has issues with month or day calculations, it could affect the results of 'plusYears'.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getYear' method is used to determine the year from milliseconds. If it miscalculates the year, it could lead to incorrect results in date calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getDayOfYear' method calculates the day of the year from milliseconds. While it is less directly related, any errors here could propagate to other date calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getDaysInYearMonth' method checks for leap years and returns the number of days in a month. While it is important, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'gregorianToJulianByYear' method converts dates between calendars. It is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure but could contribute to issues if the cutover logic is incorrect.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getLocalMillis' method simply returns the local milliseconds. It is unlikely to be the source of the failure since it does not perform any calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
