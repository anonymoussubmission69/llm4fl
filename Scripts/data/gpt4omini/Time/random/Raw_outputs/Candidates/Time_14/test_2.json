"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testPlusMonths_int_negativeFromLeap` is designed to test the `plusMonths` method of the `MonthDay` class, specifically when a negative month is added to a leap day (February 29).\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalFieldValueException` is thrown due to an invalid day of the month (29) for the resulting month (January), which only has 28 days in non-leap years.\n3. The exception is triggered in the `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds` method, which checks if the day value is within the valid range for the month.\n4. The `plusMonths` method calls `withFieldAdded`, which in turn likely leads to the `set` method of `PreciseDurationDateTimeField`, where the bounds are verified.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`plusMonths(int months)`** - This method is directly involved in the test case and is responsible for adding months to the `MonthDay` instance.\n2. **`withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`** - This method is called by `plusMonths` and is responsible for adding the specified field (months in this case).\n3. **`set(long instant, int value)`** - This method is where the exception is thrown, indicating that it is crucial to understanding the bounds checking.\n4. **`verifyValueBounds(DateTimeField field, int value, int lowerBound, int upperBound)`** - This method is responsible for verifying if the day value is within the valid range, which is where the exception originates.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 49, 0, 52]\n}\n``` \n\n- **21**: `plusMonths(int months)`\n- **49**: `withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`\n- **0**: `set(long instant, int value)`\n- **52**: `verifyValueBounds(DateTimeField field, int value, int lowerBound, int upperBound)`"
