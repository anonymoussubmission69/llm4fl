"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testPlusMonths_int_negativeEndOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of adding a negative month to a `MonthDay` object representing March 31 is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `plusMonths` method handles month-end adjustments, particularly for leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:plusMonths(I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (Method ID: 27)** - This is the method directly invoked in the test. It adds months to a `MonthDay` instance and is likely where the logic for handling month-end adjustments is implemented.\n\n2. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:withFieldAdded(Lorg/joda/time/DurationFieldType;I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (Method ID: 94)** - This method is called within `plusMonths` to add a field (in this case, months) to the `MonthDay`. It may contain logic that affects how the month addition is handled.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDaysInMonthMax(I)I` (Method ID: 55)** - This method returns the maximum number of days in a given month. It is crucial for determining if the day of the month is valid after adding months.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicDayOfMonthDateTimeField:getMaximumValue(Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePartial;[I)I` (Method ID: 88)** - This method is responsible for getting the maximum value for the day of the month, which is relevant when adjusting the day after adding months.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField:set(JI)J` (Method ID: 115)** - This method sets the month for a given instant and may include validation logic that could affect the outcome of the month addition.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDayOfMonth(JI)I` (Method ID: 60)** - This method retrieves the day of the month for a given instant and is relevant for understanding how the day is calculated after month adjustments.\n\n7. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:<init>(IILorg/joda/time/Chronology;)V` (Method ID: 17)** - The constructor for `MonthDay` initializes the object and may have implications for how the month and day are set initially.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [27, 94, 55, 88, 115, 60, 17]\n}\n```"
