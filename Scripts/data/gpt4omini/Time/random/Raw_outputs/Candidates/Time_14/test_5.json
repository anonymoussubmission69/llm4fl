"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMinusMonths_int_negativeFromLeap` is designed to test the `minusMonths` method of the `MonthDay` class. The test attempts to subtract a negative month from a leap day (February 29).\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalFieldValueException` is thrown due to an invalid day of the month (29) for the resulting month after the subtraction.\n3. The exception is triggered in the `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds` method, which checks if the day of the month is within valid bounds.\n4. The `minusMonths` method calls `withFieldAdded`, which in turn calls `FieldUtils.safeNegate` and `verifyValueBounds`.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds`**: This method is responsible for validating the bounds of the day of the month. It is crucial to understand how it determines the valid range.\n- **`MonthDay.minusMonths`**: This method is directly involved in the operation that leads to the exception.\n- **`MonthDay.withFieldAdded`**: This method is called within `minusMonths` and is responsible for adding the field, which may lead to the invalid state.\n- **`BasicDayOfMonthDateTimeField.getMaximumValue`**: This method is responsible for determining the maximum valid day for a given month, which is essential for understanding why the exception is thrown.\n- **`BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField.getMinimumValue`**: This method provides the minimum value for the month, which is relevant for the validation process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 28, 50, 9, 12]\n}\n``` \n\nHere, the method IDs correspond to:\n- 0: `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds`\n- 28: `MonthDay.minusMonths`\n- 50: `MonthDay.withFieldAdded`\n- 9: `BasicDayOfMonthDateTimeField.getMaximumValue`\n- 12: `BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField.getMinimumValue`"
