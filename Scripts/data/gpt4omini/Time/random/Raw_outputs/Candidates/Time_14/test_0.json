"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMinusMonths_int_endOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of subtracting one month from March 31 is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `minusMonths` method handles month-end adjustments, particularly in leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:minusMonths(I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (method_id: 43)** - This is the method directly involved in the test case. It is responsible for subtracting months from a `MonthDay` object.\n  \n2. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:withFieldAdded(Lorg/joda/time/DurationFieldType;I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (method_id: 95)** - This method is called within `minusMonths` and is responsible for adding or subtracting a field value, which could affect the month-end logic.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField:add(Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePartial;I[II)[I` (method_id: 42)** - This method is involved in adding months to a `ReadablePartial`, which may also affect how month-end adjustments are handled.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField:set(JI)J` (method_id: 116)** - This method sets the month and may have logic that needs to be examined for how it handles month-end scenarios.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDaysInMonthMax(I)I` (method_id: 56)** - This method returns the maximum number of days in a given month, which is crucial for determining the correct day when adjusting months.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDayOfMonth(JI)I` (method_id: 61)** - This method retrieves the day of the month for a given instant and year, which is relevant for understanding how days are calculated when months are adjusted.\n\n7. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDaysInYearMonth(II)I` (method_id: 85)** - This method returns the number of days in a specific year and month, which is important for leap year calculations.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [43, 95, 42, 116, 56, 61, 85]\n}\n```"
