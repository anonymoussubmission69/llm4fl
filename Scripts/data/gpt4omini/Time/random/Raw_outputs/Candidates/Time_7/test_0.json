"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testParseInto_monthDay_feb29_tokyo_endOfYear` is attempting to parse the date \"2 29\" using a `DateTimeFormatter`. The expected result is a `MutableDateTime` object representing February 29, 2004, which is a leap year.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalFieldValueException` is thrown, stating that the value 29 for `dayOfMonth` must be in the range [1,28]. This suggests that the parsing logic is not correctly handling leap years.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds`: This method is responsible for verifying the bounds of the day of the month.\n   - `PreciseDurationDateTimeField.set`: This method sets the value of a date field and calls the verification method.\n   - `DateTimeParserBucket.computeMillis`: This method computes the milliseconds from the parsed fields and may involve the day of the month.\n   - `DateTimeFormatter.parseInto`: This method is the entry point for parsing the date string.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds** (method_id: 108) - This method is responsible for checking if the day of the month is within valid bounds.\n2. **PreciseDurationDateTimeField.set** (method_id: 5) - This method sets the day of the month and calls the verification method.\n3. **DateTimeParserBucket.computeMillis** (method_id: 36) - This method computes the milliseconds and may be involved in the parsing logic.\n4. **DateTimeFormatter.parseInto** (method_id: 112) - This method is the main parsing method that triggers the entire process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 36, 108, 112]\n}\n```"
