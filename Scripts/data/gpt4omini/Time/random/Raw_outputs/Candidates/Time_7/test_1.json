"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testParseInto_monthDay_feb29_newYork_startOfYear` is attempting to parse the date \"2 29\" using a `DateTimeFormatter` with the pattern \"M d\". The expected result is a `MutableDateTime` representing February 29, 2004, which is a leap year.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalFieldValueException` is thrown, stating that the value 29 for `dayOfMonth` must be in the range [1,28]. This suggests that the parsing logic is not correctly handling leap years.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds`\n   - `PreciseDurationDateTimeField.set`\n   - `DateTimeParserBucket$SavedField.set`\n   - `DateTimeParserBucket.computeMillis`\n   - `DateTimeFormatter.parseInto`\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds** (method_id: 108) - This method is responsible for verifying the bounds of the day of the month and is likely where the exception is being triggered.\n2. **PreciseDurationDateTimeField.set** (method_id: 6) - This method sets the value of a date field and may not be correctly accounting for leap years.\n3. **DateTimeParserBucket$SavedField.set** (method_id: 55) - This method saves the parsed field value and may be involved in the incorrect handling of the day value.\n4. **DateTimeParserBucket.computeMillis** (method_id: 37) - This method computes the milliseconds from the parsed fields and may be where the leap year logic is failing.\n5. **DateTimeFormatter.parseInto** (method_id: 112) - This method is the entry point for parsing and may not be correctly delegating to the appropriate logic for leap years.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 37, 55, 108, 112]\n}\n```"
