"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date `-0002-06-30` does not match the actual result `-0001-06-30`. This discrepancy suggests that there is an issue with how the `plusYears` method is handling the year addition, particularly around the cutover point between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.LocalDate:plusYears(I)Lorg/joda/time/LocalDate;` (method_id: 76)** - This is the method directly involved in adding years to the `LocalDate` instance. It is crucial to analyze how it calculates the new date.\n\n2. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getYearMonthDayMillis(III)J` (method_id: 77)** - This method is responsible for converting year, month, and day into milliseconds. Any issues here could affect the date calculation.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology:gregorianToJulianByYear(J)J` (method_id: 52)** - This method converts Gregorian dates to Julian dates, which is relevant given the test's context of crossing the cutover.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology:getDateTimeMillis(IIII)J` (method_id: 53)** - This method retrieves the milliseconds for a given date, and it may also be involved in the conversion logic.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getYear(J)I` (method_id: 2)** - This method retrieves the year from a given instant, which is essential for understanding how years are calculated.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDayOfYear(JI)I` (method_id: 15)** - This method calculates the day of the year, which could be relevant if the year calculation is off.\n\n7. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDaysInYearMonth(II)I` (method_id: 31)** - This method determines the number of days in a specific month of a year, which could affect the date calculations.\n\n8. **`org.joda.time.LocalDate:getLocalMillis()J` (method_id: 1)** - This method retrieves the local milliseconds, which is fundamental to the date representation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [76, 77, 52, 53, 2, 15, 31, 1]\n}\n```"
