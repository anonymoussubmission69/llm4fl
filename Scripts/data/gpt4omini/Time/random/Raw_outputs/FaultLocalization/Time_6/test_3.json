"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date after adding years is not matching the actual date returned by the `plusYears` method. The expected date is `-0002-06-30`, but the actual date returned is `-0001-06-30`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the way the `plusYears` method calculates the year when crossing a significant boundary (in this case, the year zero).\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The plusYears method is directly responsible for adding years to a date. The failure in the test indicates that this method is not correctly handling the transition across significant year boundaries, particularly around year zero.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 53,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is involved in getting the date time in milliseconds, which is crucial for the plusYears method. If it incorrectly calculates the instant for dates around the cutover, it could lead to incorrect results in plusYears.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method calculates the milliseconds for a given year, month, and day. If there is an error in how it calculates the year or handles leap years, it could affect the plusYears method indirectly.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method retrieves the year from a given instant. If it miscalculates the year, it could lead to incorrect results in methods that depend on year calculations, including plusYears.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method calculates the day of the year from an instant. While it is less directly related to the year addition, any miscalculations here could propagate errors in date calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method determines the number of days in a given month of a year. While it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure, incorrect handling of leap years could indirectly affect date calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method converts Gregorian dates to Julian dates. While it may not be directly related to the plusYears method, any inaccuracies in date conversions could lead to unexpected results.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method simply returns the local milliseconds. It is the least suspicious as it does not perform any calculations that could lead to the failure observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
