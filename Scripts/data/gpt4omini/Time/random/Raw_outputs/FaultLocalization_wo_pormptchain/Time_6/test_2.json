"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'adjustYearForSet' checks if the year is less than or equal to zero and throws an IllegalFieldValueException if the year is zero. This is directly related to the exception thrown in the test, indicating that it may not handle the year value correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'convertByWeekyear' is responsible for converting a date based on week year. The test case involves adding a negative week year, which could lead to incorrect conversions if not handled properly.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 77,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'set' in 'BasicWeekyearDateTimeField' is responsible for setting the week year. If the week year is set incorrectly, it could lead to the IllegalFieldValueException being thrown, especially when the year is zero.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'add' in 'BasicWeekyearDateTimeField' checks if the years to add is zero and calls 'set' method. If the logic in 'set' is flawed, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement with the year and week year handling, which is central to the test case that is failing."
