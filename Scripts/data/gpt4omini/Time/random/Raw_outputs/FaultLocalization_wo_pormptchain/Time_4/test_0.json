"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'with' method in the Partial class is directly invoked in the test.

If the fieldType is not found, it returns -1, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the 'with' method. This method's logic is crucial for the correct functioning of the 'with' method.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of the Partial class is responsible for initializing the object.
