"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 15 (Constructor of Partial)**:\n   - **Issue**: The constructor checks for duplicates but has a logical flaw in the condition that checks for duplicates. The exception is thrown when duplicates are found, which is the cause of the test failure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the duplicate check logic correctly identifies duplicates before initializing the types array.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 1.\n\n2. **Method ID 7 (with method)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method adds a new field type but does not check for duplicates before creating a new Partial instance. This can lead to the same exception being thrown.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add a check for duplicates before adding the new field type to the types array.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 2.\n\n3. **Method ID 19 (Constructor with single type)**:\n   - **Issue**: This constructor does not perform any duplicate checks when initializing the types array, which could lead to issues if used incorrectly.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Implement a check for duplicates before initializing the types array.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 3.\n\n4. **Method ID 21 (indexOf method)**:\n   - **Issue**: The method incorrectly returns -1 when the type is found, which is not the expected behavior. This could lead to incorrect assumptions about the presence of types.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Change the return value to the index of the found type instead of -1.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 4.\n\n5. **Method ID 22 (getFieldType method)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method does not handle out-of-bounds access, which could lead to runtime exceptions.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add a check to ensure the index is within bounds before accessing the types array.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 5.\n\n6. **Method ID 0 (size method)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method simply returns the length of the types array and does not contribute to the error directly.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes needed.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 6.\n\nHere is the JSON output with the re-ranked methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
