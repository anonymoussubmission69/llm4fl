The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months1` is designed to test the `normalizedStandard` method of the `Period` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the `setIndexedField` method of the `PeriodType` class, which suggests that the field being accessed is not supported.\n3. The `normalizedStandard` method calls `getPeriodType().getIndexedField(this, PeriodType.DAY_INDEX)` and similar calls for other fields, which could lead to the exception if the `PeriodType` does not support the requested field.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `org.joda.time.Period:normalizedStandard(Lorg/joda/time/PeriodType;)Lorg/joda/time/Period;` (method_id: 14) - This is the method under test that is directly involved in the failure.\n- `org.joda.time.PeriodType:setIndexedField(Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePeriod;I[II)Z` (method_id: 22) - This method is where the exception is thrown, indicating a potential issue with how fields are being set.\n- `org.joda.time.Period:getPeriodType()Lorg/joda/time/PeriodType;` (method_id: 15) - This method retrieves the period type, which is crucial for the `normalizedStandard` method's operation.\n- `org.joda.time.PeriodType:indexOf(Lorg/joda/time/DurationFieldType;)I` (method_id: 19) - This method is involved in determining the index of a field type, which could be related to the unsupported operation.\n- `org.joda.time.Period:getDays()I` (method_id: 8), `org.joda.time.Period:getMonths()I` (method_id: 16), `org.joda.time.Period:getYears()I` (method_id: 23) - These methods are used to retrieve values that may be involved in the normalization process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 22, 15, 19, 8, 16, 23]\n}\n```"
