The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months2` is designed to test the `normalizedStandard` method of the `Period` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the `setIndexedField` method of the `PeriodType` class, which is called during the execution of the `normalizedStandard` method.\n3. The `normalizedStandard` method attempts to set indexed fields for years and months, which may lead to the exception if the field is not supported.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`normalizedStandard(PeriodType)`**: This is the method under test and is directly involved in the failure.\n- **`setIndexedField(ReadablePeriod, int, int[], int)`**: This method is where the exception is thrown, indicating that it is crucial to understand why the field is not supported.\n- **`getIndexedField(ReadablePeriod, int)`**: This method is called within `setIndexedField` and may provide insight into how fields are indexed and why the exception occurs.\n- **`getPeriodType()`**: This method is called to retrieve the period type, which is essential for understanding the context of the fields being accessed.\n- **`withYears(int)`**: This method is called within `normalizedStandard` to set the years, and it may also be relevant to the failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [14, 22, 43, 15, 40]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
