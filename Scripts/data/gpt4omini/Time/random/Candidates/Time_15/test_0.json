The test is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, which indicates that the expected result does not match the actual result returned by the method.\n\nThe only covered method by the failed test is `FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long val1, int val2)`. This method is responsible for multiplying a long value by an integer and includes a check for overflow. The suspicious parts of this method include:\n\n1. The handling of different cases for `val2` (the integer multiplier), particularly the return statements that seem incomplete or incorrect.\n2. The logic that checks for overflow (`if (total / val2 != val1)`), which could lead to incorrect results if not implemented properly.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious method that needs further investigation is:\n\n- `FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long val1, int val2)`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
