"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMinusMonths_int_endOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of subtracting one month from March 31 is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `minusMonths` method handles month-end dates, particularly in leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:minusMonths(I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (method_id: 43)** - This is the method directly involved in the test case. It is responsible for subtracting months from a `MonthDay` instance.\n  \n2. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:withFieldAdded(Lorg/joda/time/DurationFieldType;I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (method_id: 95)** - This method is called within `minusMonths` and is responsible for adding or subtracting a field (in this case, months). It may not be handling the end-of-month logic correctly.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDaysInYearMonth(I,I)I` (method_id: 85)** - This method determines the number of days in a given month of a year, which is crucial for validating the day when subtracting months.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField:getMaximumValue(Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePartial;[I)I` (method_id: 89)** - This method is responsible for getting the maximum value for a given month, which may affect how the day is adjusted when subtracting months.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicDayOfMonthDateTimeField:getMaximumValue()I` (method_id: 22)** - This method returns the maximum day value for the current month, which is relevant when adjusting the day after subtracting months.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.field.FieldUtils:verifyValueBounds(Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeField;III)V` (method_id: 100)** - This utility method checks if a value is within the bounds of a date field, which could be relevant if the day is being set incorrectly after the month subtraction.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [43, 95, 85, 89, 22, 100]\n}\n```"
