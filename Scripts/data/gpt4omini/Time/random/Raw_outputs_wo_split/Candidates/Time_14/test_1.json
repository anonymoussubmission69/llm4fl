"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testPlusMonths_int_negativeEndOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of adding a negative month to a `MonthDay` object representing March 31 is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `plusMonths` method handles month-end adjustments, particularly in leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:plusMonths(I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (method_id: 27)** - This is the method directly invoked in the test. It adds months to a `MonthDay` instance and is likely where the issue originates.\n\n2. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:withFieldAdded(Lorg/joda/time/DurationFieldType;I)Lorg/joda/time/MonthDay;` (method_id: 94)** - This method is called within `plusMonths` to handle the addition of the specified field (months in this case). It may contain logic that incorrectly handles month-end adjustments.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDaysInMonthMax(I)I` (method_id: 55)** - This method determines the maximum number of days in a given month. If it incorrectly identifies February as having 28 days when it should have 29 (in a leap year), it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicDayOfMonthDateTimeField:getMaximumValue(Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePartial;[I)I` (method_id: 9)** - This method is responsible for determining the maximum value for the day of the month, which is crucial for ensuring that the day is valid after month adjustments.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField:add(JI)J` (method_id: 93)** - This method adds a specified number of months to a given instant. It may also be involved in the logic that leads to the incorrect day being returned.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.MonthDay:<init>(IILorg/joda/time/Chronology;)V` (method_id: 17)** - The constructor for `MonthDay` initializes the object. If there are issues with how the month and day are set initially, it could propagate through the methods.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [27, 94, 55, 9, 93, 17]\n}\n```"
