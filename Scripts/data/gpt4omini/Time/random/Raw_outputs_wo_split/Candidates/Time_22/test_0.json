"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testConstructor_long_fixedZone` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected value is `0` but the actual value is `64`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the `Period` object is being constructed or how its fields are being calculated.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.Period:getMonths()`** - This method is directly involved in retrieving the number of months from the `Period` object, which is expected to be `0` but is returning `64`.\n2. **`org.joda.time.Period:getYears()`** - Similar to `getMonths()`, this method retrieves the number of years, which may also be contributing to the incorrect calculation.\n3. **`org.joda.time.Period:getWeeks()`** - This method retrieves the number of weeks, which is also expected to be `0`.\n4. **`org.joda.time.Period:getDays()`** - This method retrieves the number of days, which is expected to be `0`.\n5. **`org.joda.time.PeriodType:getIndexedField()`** - This method is used to get the indexed field value from the `PeriodType`, which may be involved in the calculations leading to the incorrect values.\n6. **`org.joda.time.PeriodType:size()`** - This method returns the size of the period type, which may affect how the fields are being calculated.\n7. **`org.joda.time.Period:<init>(J)`** - The constructor of the `Period` class is critical as it initializes the object with the given duration.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 33, 45, 34, 58, 4, 17]\n}\n```"
