"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSafeMultiplyLongInt` is designed to validate the behavior of the `FieldUtils.safeMultiply` method. The test is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, which indicates that the expected result does not match the actual result returned by the method.\n\nThe only covered method by the failed test is `FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long val1, int val2)`. This method is responsible for multiplying a long value by an integer and includes a check for overflow. The suspicious parts of the method include:\n\n1. The handling of the multiplication and the checks for overflow.\n2. The return statements that seem to be incomplete or incorrectly structured, as they do not cover all possible cases.\n\nGiven that the test is failing when calling this method, it is the primary suspect for the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
