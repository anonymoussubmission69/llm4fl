"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `test_plusWeekyears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date `-0002-06-30` does not match the actual result `-0001-06-28`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with how the weekyear and day calculations are being handled, particularly around the cutover period between different calendar systems.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getYear(J)`** - This method is responsible for retrieving the year from a given instant. Any issues here could affect the year calculation.\n2. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getWeekyear(J)`** - This method retrieves the weekyear from a given instant. Since the test involves adding weekyears, this method is critical.\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.BasicChronology:getDayOfWeek(J)`** - This method retrieves the day of the week from a given instant. If the day of the week is calculated incorrectly, it could lead to the wrong date being returned.\n4. **`org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology$CutoverField:add(JI)`** - This method handles the addition of years and may be involved in the transition between different calendar systems.\n5. **`org.joda.time.LocalDate:withWeekOfWeekyear(I)`** - This method sets the week of the weekyear and could be directly related to the test's failure if it does not handle the transition correctly.\n6. **`org.joda.time.LocalDate:withLocalMillis(J)`** - This method sets the local milliseconds and could affect the final date calculation.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 26, 22, 8, 112, 5]\n}\n```"
