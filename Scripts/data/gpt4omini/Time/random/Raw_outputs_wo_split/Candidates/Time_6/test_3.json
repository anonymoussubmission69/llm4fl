"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date `-0002-06-30` does not match the actual result `-0001-06-30`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with the method that calculates the year when adding a negative number of years, specifically in the `plusYears` method of the `LocalDate` class.\n\nThe stack trace points to the `assertEquals` method failing, which suggests that the methods involved in the calculation of the date are likely to be the source of the problem. The `plusYears` method is directly involved, and it may call other methods that handle the date calculations.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `GJChronology` and `LocalDate` classes, which are likely involved in the date manipulation. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **LocalDate:plusYears(int years)** - This method is directly responsible for adding years to the date.\n2. **BasicChronology:getYear(long instant)** - This method retrieves the year from a given instant, which is crucial for the year calculation.\n3. **BasicChronology:getYearMonthDayMillis(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth)** - This method calculates the milliseconds for a specific year, month, and day, which is essential for date manipulation.\n4. **GJChronology:gregorianToJulianByYear(long instant)** - This method may be involved in converting Gregorian dates to Julian dates, which could affect the year calculation.\n5. **GJChronology:withZone(DateTimeZone zone)** - This method may affect how dates are calculated based on time zones.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [76, 2, 77, 52, 57]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
