    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following insights can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months2` is failing due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` which indicates that a field is not supported when trying to set a value in the `setIndexedField` method.\n2. The stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the `normalizedStandard` method, which calls `withYears` and subsequently `setIndexedField`.\n3. The `setIndexedField` method is directly responsible for throwing the exception when it encounters an unsupported field.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods and rank them based on their suspiciousness:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The setIndexedField method throws an UnsupportedOperationException if the field is not supported.
