    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date after adding years is not matching the actual date returned by the `plusYears` method. The expected date is `-0002-06-30`, but the actual date returned is `-0001-06-30`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the way the `plusYears` method calculates the year when crossing a significant boundary (in this case, the year zero).\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The plusYears method is directly responsible for adding years to a date.
