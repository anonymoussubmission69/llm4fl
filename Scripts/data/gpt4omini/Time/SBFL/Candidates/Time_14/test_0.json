    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMinusMonths_int_endOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of subtracting one month from March 31 is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `minusMonths` method handles month-end dates, particularly in leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`minusMonths(int months)`**: This method is directly involved in the test case and is responsible for subtracting months from a `MonthDay` object.\n2. **`withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`**: This method is called within `minusMonths` and is responsible for adding or subtracting fields, which could affect the month-end logic.\n3. **`add(ReadablePartial partial, int fieldIndex, int[] values, int valueToAdd)`**: This method is involved in adding values to a `ReadablePartial`, which may include month and day adjustments.\n4. **`getDaysInMonthMax(int month)`**: This method returns the maximum number of days in a given month, which is crucial for determining the correct day when adjusting months.\n5. **`getDaysInYearMonth(int year, int month)`**: This method is used to determine the number of days in a specific month of a specific year, which is important for leap year calculations.\n6. **`isLeapYear(int year)`**: This method checks if a year is a leap year, which is essential for correctly handling February dates.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, especially in the context of handling month-end dates and leap years.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 1, 0, 4, 83, 87]\n}\n```"
