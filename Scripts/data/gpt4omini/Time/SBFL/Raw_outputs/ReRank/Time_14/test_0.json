"Based on the analysis of the test case and the retrieved method bodies, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Test Analysis**: The test `testMinusMonths_int_endOfMonthAdjust` is failing because it expects the result of subtracting one month from March 31 to be February 29 (in a leap year), but it is returning February 28. This indicates that the logic for handling month-end adjustments is likely flawed.\n\n2. **Method Analysis**:\n   - **`withFieldAdded` (method_id: 1)**: This method is responsible for adding a specified amount to a field type (in this case, months). If the logic for handling month-end adjustments is incorrect, it could lead to the wrong date being returned. This method is crucial for the test's failure.\n   - **`minusMonths` (method_id: 3)**: This method calls `withFieldAdded` with a negated month value. If `withFieldAdded` has issues, it will directly affect the output of `minusMonths`. This method is also highly suspicious.\n   - **`add` (method_id: 0)**: This method adds a value to a date. While it could lead to incorrect date calculations, it is less directly related to the failing test than the previous two methods.\n   - **`getDaysInMonthMax` (method_id: 4)**: This method returns the maximum number of days in a month. If it returns an incorrect value, it could indirectly affect month calculations, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure.\n   - **`getDaysInYearMonth` (method_id: 83)**: This method checks for leap years and returns the number of days in a month. While it could affect month calculations, it is not directly involved in the failing test case.\n   - **`isLeapYear` (method_id: 87)**: This method checks if a year is a leap year. It is the least suspicious in this context as it does not directly relate to the failing test.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **`withFieldAdded`**: Ensure that when adding months, the method correctly handles month-end adjustments, especially for leap years. If the current month has more days than the target month, it should adjust to the last valid day of the target month.\n  \n- **`minusMonths`**: This method should ensure that when subtracting months, it correctly calls `withFieldAdded` and handles the edge cases for month-end adjustments.\n\n### ReRanked Methods:\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 83,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
