"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSafeMultiplyLongInt` is designed to validate the behavior of the `FieldUtils.safeMultiply` method. The test is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, which indicates that the expected result does not match the actual result returned by the method.\n\nThe only covered method by the failed test is `FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long val1, int val2)`. This method is responsible for multiplying a long value by an integer and includes a check for overflow. The suspicious parts of the method include:\n\n1. The multiplication operation itself (`long total = val1 * val2;`), which could lead to overflow if not handled correctly.\n2. The condition that checks for overflow (`if (total / val2 != val1)`), which may not correctly identify all overflow scenarios.\n\nGiven that the test is failing when calling this method with various inputs, it is crucial to analyze this method further to identify potential faults.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
