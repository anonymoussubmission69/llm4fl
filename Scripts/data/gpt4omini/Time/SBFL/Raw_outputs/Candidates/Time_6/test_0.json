"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `test_plusWeekyears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date `-0002-06-30` does not match the actual result `-0001-06-28`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with how the week year and day of the week are being calculated or set.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`getWeekOfWeekyear()`** - This method retrieves the week of the year, which is crucial for determining the correct date when adding weeks.\n2. **`getDayOfWeek()`** - This method retrieves the day of the week, which is also essential for accurate date calculations.\n3. **`withWeekOfWeekyear(int weekOfWeekyear)`** - This method sets the week of the year, which could directly affect the resulting date.\n4. **`withDayOfWeek(int dayOfWeek)`** - This method sets the day of the week, which could also impact the final date.\n5. **`weekyear()`** - This method returns the property for the week year, which is relevant for the calculations being performed.\n6. **`addToCopy(int value)`** - This method adds a specified number of weeks to the current date, which is the main operation being tested.\n7. **`getDateTimeMillis(int year, int monthOfYear, int dayOfMonth)`** - This method is responsible for converting the date components into milliseconds, which is a fundamental part of date manipulation.\n8. **`setYear(long instant, int year)`** - This method sets the year for a given instant, which could be involved in the calculations leading to the failure.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 66]\n}\n```"
