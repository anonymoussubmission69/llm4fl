"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date `-0002-06-30` does not match the actual result `-0001-06-30`. This discrepancy suggests that there is an issue with how the `plusYears` method is handling the year addition, particularly around the cutover point between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.LocalDate:plusYears(I)Lorg/joda/time/LocalDate;`** - This method is directly involved in adding years to a `LocalDate` instance. Since the test is specifically testing this functionality, it is crucial to analyze how it handles negative year values and the cutover logic.\n\n2. **`org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology:getDateTimeMillis(IIII)J`** - This method is responsible for converting a date into milliseconds. It may contain logic that determines how dates are calculated around the cutover, which could affect the result of the `plusYears` method.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology$ImpreciseCutoverField:add(JI)J`** - This method is involved in adding a value to a date in the context of the GJChronology, which may also be relevant to how the cutover is handled.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.LocalDate:withLocalMillis(J)Lorg/joda/time/LocalDate;`** - This method is used to create a new `LocalDate` instance with a specific millisecond value. If the milliseconds are calculated incorrectly due to the cutover logic, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.LocalDate:getChronology()Lorg/joda/time/Chronology;`** - This method retrieves the chronology of the `LocalDate`, which is essential for understanding how dates are interpreted and manipulated.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.LocalDate:getLocalMillis()J`** - This method returns the local milliseconds representation of the date, which is critical for understanding how the date is being calculated and stored.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 0, 1, 5, 10, 8]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further investigated to identify the root cause of the test failure."
