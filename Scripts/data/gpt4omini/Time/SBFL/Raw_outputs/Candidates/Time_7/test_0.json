"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testParseInto_monthDay_feb29_tokyo_endOfYear` is attempting to parse the date \"2 29\" using a `DateTimeFormatter` with the pattern \"M d\". The expected result is a `MutableDateTime` object representing February 29, 2004, which is a leap year.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalFieldValueException` is thrown because the day of the month (29) is not valid for February in a non-leap year context. This suggests that the parsing logic is not correctly handling leap years.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds`: This method is responsible for verifying if the provided value is within the acceptable bounds for a given field.\n   - `PreciseDurationDateTimeField.set`: This method sets the value for a specific date-time field.\n   - `DateTimeParserBucket.computeMillis`: This method computes the milliseconds from the parsed fields.\n   - `DateTimeFormatter.parseInto`: This method is the main entry point for parsing the date-time string.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds** (method_id: 84) - This method is responsible for checking if the day value is within the valid range for the month.\n2. **PreciseDurationDateTimeField.set** (method_id: 74) - This method sets the day value and may not be correctly handling leap years.\n3. **DateTimeParserBucket.computeMillis** (method_id: 22) - This method computes the milliseconds and may be involved in the logic that leads to the exception.\n4. **DateTimeFormatter.parseInto** (method_id: 1) - This method is the main parsing method and is directly involved in the test case.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 22, 74, 84]\n}\n```"
