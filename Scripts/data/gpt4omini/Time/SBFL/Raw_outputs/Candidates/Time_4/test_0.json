"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testWith3` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` that is expected to be thrown when calling the `with` method on a `Partial` object. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs at line 364 in the `TestPartial_Basics` class, which suggests that the issue is likely related to the `with` method in the `Partial` class.\n\nThe `with` method is responsible for adding a new `DateTimeFieldType` and its corresponding value to the `Partial` object. If the `fieldType` is null or if the index of the `fieldType` is -1, it indicates that the `fieldType` is not valid, which could lead to the `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ZeroIsMaxDateTimeField` and `Partial` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. `org.joda.time.Partial:with(Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType;I)Lorg/joda/time/Partial;` - This is the method that is directly involved in the test and is likely where the exception is being thrown.\n2. `org.joda.time.Partial:indexOf(Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType;)I` - This method is called within the `with` method to find the index of the `fieldType`. If it returns -1, it indicates that the `fieldType` is not valid.\n3. `org.joda.time.DateTimeFieldType:clockhourOfDay()Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType;` - This method is used to retrieve the `DateTimeFieldType` for the clock hour of the day, which is likely the type being passed to the `with` method.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 12, 40]\n}\n```"
