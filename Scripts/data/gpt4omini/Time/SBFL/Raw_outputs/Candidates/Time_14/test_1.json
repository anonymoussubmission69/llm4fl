"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testPlusMonths_int_negativeEndOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of adding a negative month to a `MonthDay` object representing March 31 is not matching the actual result. The expected result is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `plusMonths` method handles month-end adjustments, particularly for leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`plusMonths(int months)`**: This method is directly involved in the test case and is responsible for adding months to the `MonthDay` object.\n2. **`withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`**: This method is called by `plusMonths` and is responsible for adding a specific field (in this case, months) to the `MonthDay`.\n3. **`add(ReadablePartial partial, int fieldIndex, int[] values, int valueToAdd)`**: This method is likely involved in the actual addition logic and may contain the logic that determines how to handle month-end adjustments.\n4. **`getDaysInMonthMax(int month)`**: This method is responsible for returning the maximum number of days in a given month, which is crucial for determining the correct day when adjusting months.\n5. **`getDaysInYearMonth(int year, int month)`**: This method is also relevant as it determines the number of days in a specific month of a specific year, which is important for leap year calculations.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 1, 0, 4, 82]\n}\n```"
