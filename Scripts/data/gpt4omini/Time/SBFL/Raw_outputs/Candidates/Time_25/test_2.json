"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `test_getOffsetFromLocal_Moscow_Autumn_overlap_mins` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` indicating that the expected offset was `+04:00` but the actual result was `+03:00`. This suggests that there is an issue with how the time zone offset is being calculated or applied, particularly around the transition period for daylight saving time in Moscow.\n\nThe stack trace points to the method `doTest_getOffsetFromLocal` in the `TestDateTimeZoneCutover` class, which is likely responsible for testing the offset calculation. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods related to date and time formatting, offset calculations, and chronology.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.tz.CachedDateTimeZone:getOffset(J)I`** - This method is responsible for getting the offset for a given instant, which is directly related to the failure.\n2. **`org.joda.time.tz.CachedDateTimeZone:getInfo(J)Lorg/joda/time/tz/CachedDateTimeZone$Info;`** - This method retrieves information about the time zone, which may include offset details.\n3. **`org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatter:printTo(Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;Lorg/joda/time/ReadableInstant;)V`** - This method is involved in printing the formatted date-time, which may be affected by the offset.\n4. **`org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatter:print(Lorg/joda/time/ReadableInstant;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - Similar to the previous method, this is responsible for printing the date-time string.\n5. **`org.joda.time.DateTimeUtils:getInstantMillis(Lorg/joda/time/ReadableInstant;)J`** - This method retrieves the milliseconds for a given instant, which is crucial for offset calculations.\n6. **`org.joda.time.DateTimeUtils:getInstantChronology(Lorg/joda/time/ReadableInstant;)Lorg/joda/time/Chronology;`** - This method retrieves the chronology for the instant, which may affect how the offset is calculated.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, leading to the incorrect offset being calculated.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [24, 25, 9, 8, 14, 13]\n}\n```"
