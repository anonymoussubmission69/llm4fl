"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testWith_baseAndArgHaveNoRange` is designed to test the `Partial` class, specifically the `with` method. The test fails due to an `IllegalArgumentException` indicating that the types array must not contain duplicates for the fields `era` and `year`.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the following methods as being involved in the failure:\n   - `org.joda.time.Partial.<init>(Partial.java:224)` - This is the constructor of the `Partial` class, which initializes the object.\n   - `org.joda.time.Partial.with(Partial.java:466)` - This method is called to add a new field to the `Partial` object.\n\n3. The error suggests that there is a validation issue in the constructor or the `with` method, specifically related to how types are managed within the `Partial` class.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 1**: `org.joda.time.Partial.<init>(Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType;I)V` - The constructor that initializes the `Partial` object.\n- **Method ID 2**: `org.joda.time.Partial.<init>(Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType;ILorg/joda/time/Chronology;)V` - Another constructor that may handle types differently.\n- **Method ID 3**: `org.joda.time.Partial:with(Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType;I)Lorg/joda/time/Partial;` - The method that adds a new field to the `Partial` object and is directly related to the failure.\n- **Method ID 7**: `org.joda.time.Partial:<init>([Lorg/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType;[ILorg/joda/time/Chronology;)V` - A constructor that takes arrays of types and values, which may also be relevant to the issue of duplicate types.\n\nThese methods are critical to understanding how the `Partial` class manages its internal state and validates the types being added.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 3, 7]\n}\n```"
