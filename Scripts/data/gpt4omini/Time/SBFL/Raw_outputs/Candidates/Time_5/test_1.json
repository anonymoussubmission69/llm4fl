"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months2` is designed to test the `normalizedStandard` method of the `Period` class. The test fails with an `UnsupportedOperationException` indicating that a field is not supported.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the exception originates from the `setIndexedField` method in the `PeriodType` class, which is called by the `withYears` method in the `Period` class. This suggests that the issue may be related to how the `withYears` method interacts with the `setIndexedField` method.\n\n3. The `normalizedStandard` method also calls `withYears`, which means that if `withYears` fails, it will propagate the failure back to `normalizedStandard`.\n\n4. The `getYears` and `getMonths` methods are also involved in the process of calculating the values that are passed to `withYears`, which could potentially lead to the exception if they return unexpected values.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be investigated further:\n\n- `setIndexedField` (method_id: 2): This method throws the exception when a field is not supported.\n- `withYears` (method_id: 0): This method calls `setIndexedField` and is directly involved in the failure.\n- `normalizedStandard` (method_id: 1): This method calls `withYears` and is the method under test.\n- `getYears` (method_id: 5): This method retrieves the number of years and could be returning an unexpected value.\n- `getMonths` (method_id: 6): Similar to `getYears`, this method retrieves the number of months and could also be a factor.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
