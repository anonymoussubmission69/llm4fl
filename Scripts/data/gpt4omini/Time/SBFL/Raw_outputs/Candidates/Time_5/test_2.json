"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months1` is attempting to normalize a `Period` object using the `normalizedStandard` method with a `PeriodType` of months.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown, specifically from the `setIndexedField` method in the `PeriodType` class, which suggests that the field being accessed is not supported.\n3. The `normalizedStandard` method calls `withYears`, which in turn calls `setIndexedField`. This indicates a potential chain of method calls that could lead to the exception.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`setIndexedField` (method_id: 2)**: This method is directly responsible for throwing the `UnsupportedOperationException`. It checks if the field is supported and throws an exception if not.\n- **`withYears` (method_id: 0)**: This method calls `setIndexedField`, and since it is part of the chain that leads to the exception, it should be examined.\n- **`normalizedStandard` (method_id: 1)**: This method is the one being tested and is responsible for calling `withYears`, making it crucial to analyze.\n- **`getYears` (method_id: 5)** and **`getMonths` (method_id: 6)**: These methods retrieve the values for years and months, which are used in the `normalizedStandard` method. If they return unexpected values, they could lead to the exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
