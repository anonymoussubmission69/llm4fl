"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'minusDays' method is directly involved in the test case that failed. It calls 'withFieldAdded' with a negated value of days, which is where the error originates. The test case is trying to subtract a negative number of days, which should effectively add days, but it leads to an invalid day value for February in a leap year.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'withFieldAdded' method is called by 'minusDays' and is responsible for adding the days to the current MonthDay instance. If the addition results in an invalid day (like 29 for February in a non-leap year), it will throw an exception. This method is crucial in the calculation and thus highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'verifyValueBounds' method is responsible for checking if the day value is within valid bounds. Since the exception thrown is related to an invalid day value, this method is also suspicious as it directly relates to the validation of the day value being added.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getField' method retrieves the day of the month field. If the field is not correctly set or retrieved, it could lead to invalid values being processed in the 'minusDays' method.
