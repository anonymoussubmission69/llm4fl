"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'with' method in the Partial class is directly invoked in the test.
