"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method constructor of Partial checks for duplicate types in the types array and throws an IllegalArgumentException if duplicates are found. The stack trace indicates that this method is involved in the failure due to the error message about duplicate types.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This constructor initializes a Partial object and calls another constructor. It is directly related to the creation of the Partial object that is being tested, making it suspicious as it may contribute to the issue if the input types are not validated correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'with' method adds a new field type to the Partial object. If the field type being added is a duplicate of an existing type, it could lead to the same IllegalArgumentException being thrown, making it relevant to the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This constructor also initializes a Partial object with a chronology. While it is less directly related to the failure, it still plays a role in the overall construction of the Partial object, which is under scrutiny.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
