"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'daysBetween' is directly involved in calculating the number of days between two MonthDay instances. The test fails when trying to calculate the days between a MonthDay with a day of 29 in February, which is invalid in non-leap years. This indicates that the logic in this method may not be handling edge cases correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'between' is responsible for calculating the difference between two ReadablePartial instances. Since it is called by 'daysBetween', any issues in handling the boundaries of days (like February 29) could originate here.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor for MonthDay initializes the month and day values. If the day value is set incorrectly (like 29 for February in a non-leap year), it could lead to the exception seen in the stack trace. This method is suspicious as it directly sets the values that are later used in calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 96,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'verifyValueBounds' checks if the provided value is within the acceptable range for a DateTimeField.
