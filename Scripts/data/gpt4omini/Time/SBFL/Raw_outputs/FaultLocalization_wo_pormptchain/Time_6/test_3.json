"Based on the provided test failure and the methods covered by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'plusYears(int years)' is directly involved in the test case where the date is being manipulated by adding a negative number of years. The failure indicates that the expected date was not produced, suggesting a potential issue in how years are added, especially around the cutover period.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 86,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'gregorianToJulianByYear(long instant)' is responsible for converting Gregorian dates to Julian dates. Since the test involves a significant year change, this method could be involved in incorrectly handling the transition between these calendars.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'add(long instant, int value)' in 'ImpreciseCutoverField' is responsible for adding values to an instant. If there is an issue with how it handles the cutover, it could lead to incorrect date calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getDateMidnightMillis(int year, int monthOfYear, int dayOfMonth)' verifies value bounds for the date components. If the bounds are not correctly defined, it could lead to incorrect date calculations, especially around leap years or month-end transitions.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
