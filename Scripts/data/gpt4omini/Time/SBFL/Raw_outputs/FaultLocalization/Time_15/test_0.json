However, the implementation is incorrect as it contains unreachable code and lacks proper handling for overflow conditions. The switch statement is improperly structured, and the return statements before the multiplication logic will prevent the method from executing as intended. This could lead to unexpected results or exceptions, which aligns with the failing test case that expects specific multiplication results.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
