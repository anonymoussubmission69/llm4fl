    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testPlusMonths_int_negativeEndOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of adding a negative month to a `MonthDay` object representing March 31 is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `plusMonths` method handles month-end adjustments, particularly for leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`plusMonths(int months)`** - This method is directly involved in the test case and is responsible for adding months to the `MonthDay` object.\n2. **`withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`** - This method is called by `plusMonths` and is responsible for adding a specific field (in this case, months) to the `MonthDay`.\n3. **`add(ReadablePartial partial, int fieldIndex, int[] values, int valueToAdd)`** - This method is likely involved in the actual addition of months and may contain logic that affects how month-end adjustments are handled.\n4. **`add(long instant, int months)`** - This method is responsible for adding months to a given instant and may also be involved in the month-end adjustment logic.\n5. **`getDaysInYearMonth(int year, int month)`** - This method is responsible for determining the number of days in a given month of a year, which is crucial for handling leap years correctly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 1, 0, 7, 91]\n}\n```"
