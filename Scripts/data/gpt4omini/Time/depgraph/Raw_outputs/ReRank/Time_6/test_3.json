"Based on the analysis of the test case and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Test Case Analysis**: The test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date after adding years is `-0002-06-30`, but the actual result is `-0001-06-30`. This indicates that the `plusYears` method is not correctly handling the addition of years, particularly around the cutover point.\n\n2. **Method Analysis**:\n   - **Method 2 (`plusYears`)**: This method is directly responsible for adding years to a `LocalDate`. The logic seems to be flawed, especially in how it handles the addition of negative years and the cutover condition.\n   - **Method 0 (`add`)**: This method adds a value to a timestamp and checks for cutover conditions. If it has a bug, it could affect the `plusYears` method.\n   - **Method 1 (`getDateTimeMillis`)**: This method retrieves the date-time in milliseconds and checks against the cutover. An error here could lead to incorrect results in `plusYears`.\n   - **Methods 3 and 4 (Constructors)**: These methods initialize `LocalDate` objects. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to issues in subsequent method calls, including `plusYears`.\n   - **Methods 9 and 10**: These methods simply return values and are less likely to be the source of the problem.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **Method 2 (`plusYears`)**: Ensure that the addition of years correctly handles the transition across the cutover. This may involve checking the current date against the cutover before performing the addition and adjusting the logic accordingly.\n  \n- **Method 0 (`add`)**: Review the logic that handles the cutover condition to ensure it correctly transitions between Gregorian and Julian calendars.\n\n- **Method 1 (`getDateTimeMillis`)**: Ensure that the method correctly calculates the milliseconds for dates around the cutover.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\nGiven the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking reflects the likelihood of each method contributing to the test failure, with `plusYears` being the most suspicious due to its direct involvement in the failing test case."
