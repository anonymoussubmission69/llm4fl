"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `test_plusYears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date after adding years is not matching the actual result. The expected date is `-0002-06-30`, but the actual result is `-0001-06-30`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the `plusYears` method is handling the addition of years, especially around the cutover point between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods to determine their suspiciousness:\n\n1. **Method 2 (`plusYears`)**: This method is directly involved in the test case. It adds years to a date and is likely where the fault originates. The fact that the test is failing indicates that this method may not be correctly handling the addition of years, especially around the cutover.\n\n2. **Method 0 (`add`)**: This method is responsible for adding a value to a timestamp. It checks for the cutover and may be involved in the logic that determines how years are added. If this method has a bug, it could propagate to the `plusYears` method.\n\n3. **Method 1 (`getDateTimeMillis`)**: This method retrieves the date-time in milliseconds and checks against the cutover. If it incorrectly calculates the date-time, it could affect the results of `plusYears`.\n\n4. **Method 3 (Constructor)**: This constructor initializes a `LocalDate` object. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to issues in subsequent method calls, including `plusYears`.\n\n5. **Method 4 (Constructor)**: Similar to Method 3, this constructor initializes a `LocalDate` object. It may also contribute to the problem if the initialization is not handled correctly.\n\n6. **Method 9 (`getLocalMillis`)**: This method simply returns the local milliseconds. It is less likely to be the source of the problem since it does not perform any calculations.\n\n7. **Method 10 (`getChronology`)**: This method returns the chronology. It is unlikely to be the source of the issue since it does not involve any logic that could lead to a failure in date calculations.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The plusYears method is directly responsible for adding years to a LocalDate.
