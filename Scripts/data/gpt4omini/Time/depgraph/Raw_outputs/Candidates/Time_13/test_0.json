"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testFormatStandard_negative` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` indicating that the expected output was `PT-0.008S` but the actual output was `PT0.008S`. This suggests that there is an issue with how negative values are being formatted, particularly in the `withMillis` method of the `Period` class.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.joda.time.Period:withMillis(I)Lorg/joda/time/Period;`** - This method is directly involved in setting the milliseconds for the `Period` object, which is crucial for the formatting of the output.\n\n2. **`org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter:print(Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePeriod;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is responsible for printing the `ReadablePeriod`, which includes the formatting logic that is failing in the test.\n\n3. **`org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatterBuilder$FieldFormatter:printTo(Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePeriod;Ljava/util/Locale;)V`** - This method handles the actual printing to a `StringBuffer`, and any issues in how it formats negative values could lead to the observed failure.\n\n4. **`org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatterBuilder$FieldFormatter:getFieldValue(Lorg/joda/time/ReadablePeriod;)J`** - This method retrieves the field value from the `ReadablePeriod`, and if it does not handle negative values correctly, it could affect the output.\n\n5. **`org.joda.time.Period:<init>([ILorg/joda/time/PeriodType;)V`** - The constructor for `Period` initializes the object, and if the values are not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect formatting.\n\n6. **`org.joda.time.Period:millis(I)Lorg/joda/time/Period;`** - This method creates a `Period` from milliseconds, and if it does not handle negative values properly, it could propagate issues to the formatting methods.\n\n7. **`org.joda.time.Period:seconds(I)Lorg/joda/time/Period;`** - Similar to the `millis` method, this method creates a `Period` from seconds, and any issues here could also affect the output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 6, 1, 3, 17, 7, 8]\n}\n```"
