"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMinusMonths_int_endOfMonthAdjust` is failing because the expected result of subtracting one month from March 31 is February 29, but the actual result is February 28. This indicates a potential issue with how the `minusMonths` method handles month-end dates, particularly in leap years.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`minusMonths(int months)`**: This method is directly involved in the test case and is responsible for subtracting months from a `MonthDay` object.\n2. **`withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`**: This method is called within `minusMonths` and is responsible for adding or subtracting a field (in this case, months).\n3. **`add(ReadablePartial partial, int fieldIndex, int[] values, int valueToAdd)`**: This method is likely involved in the addition/subtraction logic for the month field.\n4. **`add(long instant, int months)`**: This method is responsible for adding months to a given instant, which may affect how the month is calculated.\n5. **`getDaysInYearMonth(int year, int month)`**: This method determines the number of days in a specific month of a year, which is crucial for handling leap years correctly.\n6. **`getMaximumValue()`**: This method may be involved in determining the maximum day value for a month, which could affect the outcome when subtracting months.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 1, 0, 7, 92, 28]\n}\n```"
