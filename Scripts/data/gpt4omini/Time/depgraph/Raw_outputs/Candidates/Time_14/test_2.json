"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testPlusMonths_int_negativeFromLeap` is designed to test the `plusMonths` method of the `MonthDay` class, specifically when a negative month is added to a leap day (February 29).\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalFieldValueException` is thrown due to an invalid day of the month (29) for the month of January, which only has 28 days in non-leap years.\n3. The methods involved in this process include:\n   - `plusMonths(int months)`: This method calls `withFieldAdded`.\n   - `withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`: This method is responsible for adding the specified field (in this case, months) to the current `MonthDay`.\n   - `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds`: This method is called to verify if the day of the month is within valid bounds.\n\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n1. **`plusMonths(int months)`** - Directly involved in the test case.\n2. **`withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`** - Called by `plusMonths`, responsible for adding the month.\n3. **`FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds`** - This method is responsible for checking the validity of the day of the month and is where the exception is thrown.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 42]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 1 corresponds to `plusMonths(int months)`.\n- Method ID 0 corresponds to `withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`.\n- Method ID 42 corresponds to `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds`."
