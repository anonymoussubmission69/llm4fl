"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMinusMonths_int_negativeFromLeap` is designed to test the `minusMonths` method of the `MonthDay` class. The test attempts to subtract a negative month from a leap day (February 29).\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalFieldValueException` is thrown due to an invalid day of the month (29) for the resulting month after the operation. This suggests that the logic for handling leap years and month boundaries is not functioning correctly.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace that are likely contributing to the issue include:\n   - `minusMonths(int months)`: This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for the logic of subtracting months.\n   - `withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)`: This method is called within `minusMonths` and is responsible for adding or subtracting fields.\n   - `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds(DateTimeField field, int value, int lowerBound, int upperBound)`: This method is responsible for verifying if the day of the month is within valid bounds, which is where the exception is thrown.\n   - `BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField.set(long instant, int month)`: This method is involved in setting the month and may also be contributing to the issue if it does not handle leap years correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 43, 10]\n}\n``` \n\n- **1**: `minusMonths(int months)` - Directly involved in the test.\n- **0**: `withFieldAdded(DurationFieldType fieldType, int amount)` - Called by `minusMonths`.\n- **43**: `FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds(DateTimeField field, int value, int lowerBound, int upperBound)` - Responsible for the exception.\n- **10**: `BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField.set(long instant, int month)` - May not handle leap years correctly."
