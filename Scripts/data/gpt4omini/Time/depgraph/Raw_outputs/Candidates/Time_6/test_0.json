"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `test_plusWeekyears_positiveToNegative_crossCutover` is failing because the expected date `-0002-06-30` does not match the actual result `-0001-06-28`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with how the week year calculations are being handled, particularly around the cutover point between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`add(long instant, int value)`** - This method is responsible for adding a value to a given instant. It contains logic that checks if the instant is greater than or equal to the cutover, which is critical for determining how dates are calculated around the transition from Julian to Gregorian calendars.\n\n2. **`convertByWeekyear(long instant, Chronology from, Chronology to)`** - This method converts an instant from one chronology to another based on the week year. It is directly involved in the conversion process that could lead to the incorrect date being returned.\n\n3. **`getDateTimeMillis(int year, int monthOfYear, int dayOfMonth)`** - This method retrieves the date-time in milliseconds for a given year, month, and day. It includes checks for the cutover, which could affect the resulting instant.\n\n4. **`gregorianToJulianByWeekyear(long instant)`** - This method converts a Gregorian date to a Julian date based on the week year. If there is an error in this conversion, it could lead to the discrepancies observed in the test.\n\n5. **`addToCopy(int value)`** - This method is used in the test to add a negative value to the week year. If there is an issue with how this addition is handled, it could lead to incorrect date calculations.\n\n6. **`withWeekOfWeekyear(int weekOfWeekyear)`** - This method sets the week of the week year for a date. If the week year is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect date calculations.\n\n7. **`withDayOfWeek(int dayOfWeek)`** - Similar to the previous method, if the day of the week is not set correctly, it could also lead to incorrect date calculations.\n\n8. **`getWeekOfWeekyear()`** - This method retrieves the week of the week year for the current date. If this value is incorrect, it could propagate errors in date calculations.\n\n9. **`getDayOfWeek()`** - This method retrieves the day of the week for the current date. Similar to the previous methods, if this value is incorrect, it could lead to further discrepancies.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 7, 8]\n}\n```"
