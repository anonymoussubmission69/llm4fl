"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testNormalizedStandard_periodType_months2` is designed to test the `normalizedStandard` method of the `Period` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the `setIndexedField` method of the `PeriodType` class, which suggests that the field being accessed is not supported.\n3. The `normalizedStandard` method calls several other methods, including `getMillis`, `getYears`, `getMonths`, and `withYears`, which may also be involved in the failure.\n\nThe covered methods that are potentially suspicious and need further analysis are:\n\n- `normalizedStandard` (method_id: 0): This is the method under test and is the entry point for the failure.\n- `setIndexedField` (method_id: 2): This method throws the exception, indicating that it is directly related to the failure.\n- `withYears` (method_id: 3): This method is called within `normalizedStandard` and may be involved in the failure.\n- `getYears` (method_id: 12): This method retrieves the number of years and is used in the `normalizedStandard` method.\n- `getMonths` (method_id: 13): Similar to `getYears`, this method retrieves the number of months and is also used in `normalizedStandard`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3, 12, 13]\n}\n```"
