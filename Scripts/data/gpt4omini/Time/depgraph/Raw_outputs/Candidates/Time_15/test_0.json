"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSafeMultiplyLongInt` is designed to validate the behavior of the `FieldUtils.safeMultiply` method. The test is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, which indicates that the expected result does not match the actual result returned by the method.\n\nThe only covered method by the failed test is `FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long val1, int val2)`. This method is responsible for multiplying a long value by an integer and includes a check for overflow. The suspicious parts of this method include:\n\n1. The handling of the multiplication and the potential for overflow.\n2. The return statements that seem to be incomplete or incorrectly structured, particularly the `switch` statement which does not have proper cases defined.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is `FieldUtils.safeMultiply`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
