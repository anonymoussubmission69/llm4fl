    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test case and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Test Case Analysis**: The test case `testPlusMonths_int_negativeEndOfMonthAdjust` is failing because it expects the result of `plusMonths(-1)` on March 31 to be February 29 (a leap year), but it is returning February 28. This indicates that the logic for handling month addition, especially at the end of months, is flawed.\n\n2. **Method Analysis**:\n   - **Method 4 (`plusMonths`)**: This method directly calls `withFieldAdded`, which is responsible for adding the specified number of months. It is highly suspicious as it is the entry point for the month addition logic.\n   - **Method 1 (`withFieldAdded`)**: This method handles the addition of fields (months in this case) and calls the `add` method. It is also suspicious as it is involved in the addition logic.\n   - **Method 7 (`add`)**: This method contains the logic for adjusting the day when adding months. It is crucial for ensuring that the day remains valid after the month addition, making it very suspicious.\n   - **Method 0 (`add` for ReadablePartial)**: This method is less directly related to the MonthDay addition but could still affect the overall logic. It is less suspicious than the others.\n   - **Method 91 (`getDaysInYearMonth`)**: This method checks for leap years and returns the number of days in a month. While relevant, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n1. **Method 4 (`plusMonths`)** - Most suspicious due to direct involvement in the failing test.\n2. **Method 1 (`withFieldAdded`)** - Suspicious as it handles the addition logic.\n3. **Method 7 (`add`)** - Suspicious due to its role in adjusting the day after month addition.\n4. **Method 0 (`add` for ReadablePartial)** - Less suspicious but still relevant.\n5. **Method 91 (`getDaysInYearMonth`)** - Least suspicious as it is not directly related to the month addition logic.\n\n### Potential Fixes\n- **Method 4 (`plusMonths`)**: Ensure that when adding a negative month, the logic correctly handles the transition from March 31 to February 29 (if it's a leap year). This may involve checking if the resulting month is February and adjusting the day accordingly.\n  \n- **Method 1 (`withFieldAdded`)**: Validate the amount being added and ensure that it correctly handles edge cases, such as transitioning from the end of a month to the beginning of the next month.\n\n- **Method 7 (`add`)**: Implement logic to check if the resulting month has fewer days than the original day. If so, adjust the day to the last valid day of the resulting month.\n\nHere is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 91,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
