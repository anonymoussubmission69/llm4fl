    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `parentlessToString` is attempting to convert an `Element` to a string after removing it from its parent. This leads to a `NullPointerException` when calling `outerHtml` on a node that no longer has a parent.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurs in the `outerHtml` method of the `Node` class, which is called by the `toString` method of the `Element` class.\n3. The `remove` method is directly involved in the test, as it is called to remove the `img` element from its parent, which is likely the root cause of the issue.\n\nGiven this context, the following methods are ranked from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The remove method directly removes the node from its parent.
