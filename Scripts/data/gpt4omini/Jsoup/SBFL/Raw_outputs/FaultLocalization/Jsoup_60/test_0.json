"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test is expecting a `SelectorParseException` but is receiving an `IllegalArgumentException` instead. This indicates that there is a problem with how the input is being processed, particularly in relation to empty strings.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'contains' method checks for an empty search text and throws an exception if it is empty. Since the test is failing due to an unexpected exception, this method is highly suspicious as it directly relates to the input being processed.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'notEmpty' method is responsible for throwing an IllegalArgumentException when the input string is empty. This method is crucial in validating inputs and is likely involved in the failure of the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'byTag' method consumes an element selector and checks if it is not empty. If the input is empty, it will call 'notEmpty', which could lead to the IllegalArgumentException seen in the stack trace.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'findElements' method is responsible for determining which parsing method to call based on the input. While it does not directly throw exceptions, it could lead to the invocation of methods that do.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'parse' method initializes a QueryParser and calls its parse method. It is less suspicious compared to others as it is more of a wrapper and does not directly handle input validation.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
