"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the failure is due to a `SelectorParseException` when trying to parse the query `div:not(.left)`. This indicates that the issue lies within the parsing logic of the selector, particularly in how the `:not` pseudo-class is handled.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method creates a new Selector instance with the provided query and root element. If the query is malformed (like 'div:not(.left)'), it will lead to parsing issues. Since the test fails at this point, this method is highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor for Selector validates the query and initializes the TokenQueue. If the query is invalid, it may not throw an error here but will lead to issues later in parsing. This makes it suspicious as it directly deals with the query input.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if a sequence matches the current position in the queue. If the parsing logic is incorrect, it could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to match selectors, making it suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method consumes an element selector from the token queue. If the token queue is not correctly set up or if it encounters unexpected tokens, it could lead to parsing errors, making it somewhat suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method consumes a tag name from the token queue. Similar to the previous methods, if the queue is not correctly processed, it could lead to issues, but it is less directly related to the failure than the others.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 128,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Method body not found, but if it relates to selector parsing, it could be relevant. However, without the body, it cannot be ranked higher.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 129,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Method body not found, similar reasoning as method 128.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 130,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Method body not found, similar reasoning as method 128.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 131,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Method body not found, similar reasoning as method 128.\",\n        \"rank\": 9\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the direct involvement of each method in the selector parsing process and their potential to contribute to the observed failure."
