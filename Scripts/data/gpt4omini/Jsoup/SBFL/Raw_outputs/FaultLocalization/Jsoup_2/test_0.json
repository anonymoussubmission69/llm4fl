"Based on the analysis of the test case and the stack trace, the test is failing because the expected HTML output does not match the actual output. The test is specifically checking the handling of text nodes in HTML, particularly around script tags. \n\nThe most suspicious methods are those that deal with text processing, escaping, and HTML structure, as they are likely to affect the output of the `TextUtil.stripNewlines(doc.html())` method. \n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method escapes HTML text and normalizes whitespace. If it fails to escape or normalize correctly, it could lead to incorrect HTML output, which is the issue in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method appends the whole data to a StringBuilder. If the data is not properly escaped or formatted, it could lead to incorrect HTML output.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method retrieves the whole data from attributes. If the data is not correctly set or retrieved, it could lead to incorrect output.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method retrieves the whole text from attributes. Similar to method_id 1, if the text is not correctly set or retrieved, it could lead to incorrect output.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method parses text nodes. If it does not handle text correctly, especially around special characters or tags, it could lead to incorrect HTML output.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if a tag can contain a child. While it is less directly related to text processing, incorrect tag handling could affect the overall structure of the HTML.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This constructor initializes a tag. If tags are not initialized correctly, it could lead to structural issues in the HTML.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method returns an iterator for contents. It is less likely to be the source of the issue but could affect how elements are processed.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method adds an element to contents. While it is important, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 103,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if the current element is data. It is less relevant to the current test case.\",\n        \"rank\": 10\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 109,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method creates a tag from a string. It is the least suspicious as it deals with tag creation rather than text processing.\",\n        \"rank\": 11\n    }\n]\n```"
