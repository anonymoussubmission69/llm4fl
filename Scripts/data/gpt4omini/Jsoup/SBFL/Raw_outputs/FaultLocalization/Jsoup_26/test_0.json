"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the `NullPointerException` occurs in the `copySafeNodes` method of the `Cleaner` class, which suggests that there might be an issue with how nodes are being processed or copied. The test case is specifically testing the cleaning of a frameset, which may not be handled correctly by the `Cleaner` class.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 190,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'copySafeNodes' is responsible for copying nodes from the source to the destination. The NullPointerException suggests that it may be trying to access a property or method on a null object, likely due to an unhandled case in the node processing logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 189,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'clean' method calls 'copySafeNodes' and passes the body of the dirty document. If the dirty document is not properly initialized or contains unexpected elements, it could lead to a NullPointerException in 'copySafeNodes'.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'clean' method here initializes a 'Cleaner' and calls its 'clean' method. If the 'dirty' document is not parsed correctly, it could lead to issues in the cleaning process, potentially causing a NullPointerException.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is a wrapper that calls another 'clean' method. While it is less suspicious than the previous methods, it still plays a role in the cleaning process and could propagate issues if the input is not handled correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'parse' method is responsible for parsing HTML. If it fails to parse the input correctly, it could lead to a null document being passed to the cleaner, which would cause a NullPointerException.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method initializes the parsing process and validates inputs. While it does check for null values, if the input is not valid, it could lead to issues later in the parsing process.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method reads tokens from the tokenizer. If the tokenizer is not set up correctly, it could lead to issues, but it is less likely to directly cause a NullPointerException.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method simply parses HTML. It is less suspicious as it does not directly interact with the cleaning process, but it could still contribute to issues if the input is malformed.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 60,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks for null objects but does not provide any functionality that would directly lead to a NullPointerException. It is more of a utility method.\",\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method creates a new Document and validates the base URI.
