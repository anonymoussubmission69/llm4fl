"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testDetectCharsetEncodingDeclaration` is failing because it expected the charset to be `ISO-8859-1`, but it was `UTF-8`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the charset is being detected or parsed in the methods related to charset handling.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 176,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for parsing byte data and detecting the charset from the BOM or meta tags. Since the test failure is related to incorrect charset detection, this method is highly suspicious as it directly handles charset parsing.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 175,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method loads the input stream and calls the parseByteData method. It is suspicious because it is the entry point for parsing and could be passing incorrect parameters to the parsing method.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method parses the input HTML and could be involved in how the document is built. If there are issues in how the input is parsed, it could lead to incorrect charset detection.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 117,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method initializes the parsing process and sets the document's output settings. While it may not directly affect charset detection, it could influence how the document is processed.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 179,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method validates the charset but does not seem to be directly involved in the parsing process. It is less suspicious compared to the others but still relevant.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method simply returns the charset from output settings and does not involve any parsing logic. It is the least suspicious in the context of the charset detection failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
