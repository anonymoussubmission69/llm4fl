"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the failure is due to a `SelectorParseException` when trying to parse a CSS query that includes brackets. The test is attempting to select elements with specific attributes that contain special characters, which may not be handled correctly by the parsing logic.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 158,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method handles attribute selection and includes logic for parsing attributes with special characters. The failure in the test indicates that the parsing logic may not correctly handle brackets, making this method highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 155,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is part of the query parsing process and is responsible for consuming tokens from the query. If it does not correctly handle special characters or brackets, it could lead to parsing errors, making it suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 152,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method initializes the query parser with a token queue. If the token queue does not handle special characters correctly, it could lead to issues in parsing, making it a potential source of the problem.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for selecting elements based on a CSS query.
