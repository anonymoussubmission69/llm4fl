"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `absHandlesRelativeQuery` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected absolute URL does not match the actual URL returned by the method being tested. The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `absUrl` method when handling relative URLs.\n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n\n1. **Method 1: `absUrl(String attributeKey)`**\n   - This method constructs an absolute URL based on a relative URL obtained from an attribute. It first checks if the attribute is not empty, retrieves the relative URL, and then constructs the absolute URL using the base URI.\n   - **Suspicion**: The failure in the test suggests that the method may not be correctly handling the case where the attribute does not exist, leading to an incorrect base URL being used. This is the most suspicious method as it directly relates to the test failure.\n\n2. **Method 3: `attr(String attributeKey)`**\n   - This method retrieves the value of an attribute if it exists. It checks if the attribute is not null and then returns the corresponding value from the attributes map.\n   - **Suspicion**: If this method fails to return the correct relative URL, it would lead to the `absUrl` method constructing an incorrect absolute URL. However, it is less suspicious than `absUrl` since it does not directly cause the failure but rather supports it.\n\n3. **Method 4: `hasAttr(String attributeKey)`**\n   - This method checks if an attribute exists in the attributes map. It validates that the attribute key is not null and returns a boolean indicating its presence.\n   - **Suspicion**: This method is less suspicious because it only checks for the existence of an attribute and does not directly contribute to the URL construction process.\n\n4. **Method 0: `parse(String html, String baseUri)`**\n   - This method parses the HTML and returns a Document object. It does not interact with the URL construction or attribute retrieval directly.\n   - **Suspicion**: This method is the least suspicious as it is not involved in the logic that leads to the test failure.\n\n### Ranking of Methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The absUrl method is responsible for constructing the absolute URL from a relative URL.
