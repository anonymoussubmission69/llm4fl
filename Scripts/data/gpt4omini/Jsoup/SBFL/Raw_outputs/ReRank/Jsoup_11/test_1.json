"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the failure occurs due to a parsing issue with the query `div:not(.left)`. The stack trace indicates that the error arises from the `Selector` class when trying to parse this query, specifically pointing to an unexpected token at `:not(.left)`.\n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **Method ID 5**: \n   - **Body**: Creates a new `Selector` instance with the provided query and root element.\n   - **Issue**: If the query is malformed, it leads to parsing issues. This method is highly suspicious as it directly initiates the parsing process.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add validation to check if the query is well-formed before creating the `Selector` instance.\n\n2. **Method ID 3**: \n   - **Body**: The constructor for `Selector` validates the query and initializes the `TokenQueue`.\n   - **Issue**: If the query is invalid, it may not throw an error but will lead to issues later in parsing. This method is also suspicious.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Enhance validation to provide more specific error messages for malformed queries.\n\n3. **Method ID 47**: \n   - **Body**: Checks if a sequence matches the current position in the queue.\n   - **Issue**: If the parsing logic is incorrect, it could lead to unexpected behavior. However, it is less directly related to the failure than the previous methods.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the matching logic correctly handles edge cases, especially with malformed queries.\n\n4. **Method ID 23**: \n   - **Body**: Consumes an element selector from the token queue.\n   - **Issue**: If the token queue is not correctly set up or encounters unexpected tokens, it could lead to parsing errors.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add checks to ensure that the token queue is in a valid state before consuming.\n\n5. **Method ID 36**: \n   - **Body**: Consumes a tag name from the token queue.\n   - **Issue**: Similar to method 23, but less directly related to the failure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Similar to method 23, ensure the token queue is valid before consumption.\n\n6. **Method IDs 128, 129, 130, 131**: \n   - **Body**: Not found.\n   - **Issue**: Cannot assess their relevance without the method body.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Review these methods if they relate to selector parsing once their bodies are available.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods\n\nGiven the analysis, the re-ranking of methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 128,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 129,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 130,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 131,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    }\n]\n```"
