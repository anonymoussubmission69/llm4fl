"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 111,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'insert' in 'XmlTreeBuilder' is responsible for inserting comments into the document. Since the test is failing on parsing XML declarations, this method could be mishandling the insertion of XML declarations, leading to the failure in retrieving the expected attributes.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 110,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'insert' in 'XmlTreeBuilder' handles the insertion of start tags. If the start tag is not processed correctly, it could lead to issues in the document structure, affecting the retrieval of attributes later on.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 107,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'process' in 'XmlTreeBuilder' processes different token types. If it incorrectly processes the XML declaration token, it could lead to missing attributes, which is the issue observed in the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parse' in 'Jsoup' initiates the parsing process. If there are issues in the initial parsing setup or configuration, it could lead to failures in parsing XML declarations correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in handling XML declarations and attributes, which are central to the test that is failing."
