"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods, the following methods are ranked from most to least suspicious regarding the failure of the test:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'select' in the Element class is responsible for selecting elements based on a CSS query. The test is checking for class names in a case-insensitive manner, which may involve this method if the class selection is not handled correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 56,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'get' in the Attributes class retrieves the value of an attribute by its key. If the class names are not being retrieved correctly due to case sensitivity issues, this method could be involved.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'normalizeTag' in the ParseSettings class normalizes the tag name. If the tag names are not being normalized correctly, it could lead to issues with class name retrieval.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 65,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'normalizeAttributes' in the ParseSettings class normalizes the attributes. If the attributes are not being normalized correctly, it could affect the retrieval of class names.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parse' in the Parser class is responsible for parsing the HTML input. If the parsing logic does not handle case sensitivity correctly, it could lead to issues with class name retrieval.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the likelihood that these methods are involved in the failure of the test, particularly in relation to class name handling and case sensitivity."
