"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious, ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 28,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'findElements' is responsible for parsing the selector query. The error indicates that it could not parse the query due to an unexpected token, which suggests that this method may not be handling the input correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'byAttribute' is involved in processing attribute selectors. Since the test is using a regex combined attribute selector, this method may not be correctly interpreting the regex syntax, leading to the parsing error.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'combinator' is responsible for handling combinators in the selector query. If it does not properly handle the input, it could lead to parsing issues, especially with complex selectors.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of the 'Selector' class initializes the query and the token queue. If the query is not validated properly before being processed, it could lead to parsing errors.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
