"Based on the provided test body and the stack trace, the test `testElementSiblingIndexSameContent` is failing due to an assertion that checks the sibling index of elements with the same content. The relevant methods that are covered by the failed test include:\n\n1. `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:elementSiblingIndex()`\n2. `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:indexInList(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Ljava/util/List;)`\n\nThe most suspicious methods are likely related to the logic that determines the sibling index of an element. Here\u2019s the ranking of the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 90,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'elementSiblingIndex()' is directly responsible for returning the sibling index of an element. If this method has a bug, it would directly cause the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 91,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'indexInList()' is called by 'elementSiblingIndex()' to find the index of the current element in its parent's children. If this method does not correctly find the index, it would also lead to a failure in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the functionality being tested. The first method is the primary method being tested, while the second method is a helper method that supports the first."
