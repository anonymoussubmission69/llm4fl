"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'outerHtml' in 'TextNode' is responsible for generating the HTML representation of the text node. It includes logic for normalizing whitespace and handling block elements, which could lead to discrepancies in the expected output if not handled correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'html' in 'Element' constructs the HTML string for the element. It calls 'html' on its child nodes, which could lead to issues if the child nodes are not processed correctly, especially in nested structures.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 75,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'normalise' in 'Document' is responsible for normalizing the document structure. If the normalization logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect HTML output, which is evident in the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 40,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'popStackToSuitableContainer' in 'Parser' is responsible for managing the parsing stack. If it incorrectly identifies the suitable parent for a tag, it could lead to malformed HTML output.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'stackHasValidParent' checks if the current stack has a valid parent for the child tag. If this logic fails, it could lead to incorrect nesting of elements, contributing to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their potential impact on the output HTML structure and their relevance to the test case that failed."
