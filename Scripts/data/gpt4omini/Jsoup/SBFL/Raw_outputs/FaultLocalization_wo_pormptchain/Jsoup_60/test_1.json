"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'notEmpty' checks if a string is null or empty and throws an IllegalArgumentException if it is.

If the key is empty, it will also lead to an IllegalArgumentException. This method is directly related to the parsing logic that is failing in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'consumeElementSelector' is responsible for consuming an element selector from the TokenQueue. If it fails to consume a valid selector, it may lead to an empty string being passed to the 'notEmpty' method, causing the IllegalArgumentException.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parse' initializes a QueryParser with the provided query string.
