"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 154,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parse()' in 'QueryParser' is responsible for parsing the query string. The test fails due to a 'SelectorParseException', indicating that the query could not be parsed correctly. This suggests that there may be an issue with how the query is being processed in this method.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 155,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'findElements()' in 'QueryParser' is called during the parsing process. If the query is malformed or contains unexpected tokens, this method could be the source of the error, leading to the failure of the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 156,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'byAttribute()' in 'QueryParser' is responsible for handling attribute selectors. Given that the test involves attributes with brackets, this method could be involved in the parsing failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 150,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of 'Selector' initializes the query parsing process. If the query is invalid, it could lead to issues in subsequent parsing methods, making this method suspicious as well.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the parsing process that led to the test failure."
