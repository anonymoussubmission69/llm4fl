"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;' is responsible for selecting elements based on a query.
