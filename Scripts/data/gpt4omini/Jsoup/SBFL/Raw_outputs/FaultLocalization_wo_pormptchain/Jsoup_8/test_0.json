"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'toString()' method in the Element class calls 'outerHtml()' which is responsible for generating the HTML representation of the element. The NullPointerException indicates that it likely tries to access a property of 'img' that no longer has a parent after 'img.remove()' is called.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'remove()' method in the Node class removes the node from its parent. If 'img' is removed and then 'toString()' is called, it may lead to a situation where 'parentNode' is null, causing a NullPointerException when 'outerHtml()' is invoked.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'outerHtml()' method in the Node class is called by 'toString()'.
