"Based on the provided test body and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 183,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'isValid' method in the Cleaner class is responsible for validating a document against a whitelist. The test fails when it checks if a document is valid or not, indicating that this method may not be correctly implementing the validation logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 184,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'copySafeNodes' method is involved in copying nodes from the source document to the destination document. If this method does not correctly identify safe nodes, it could lead to incorrect validation results.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 182,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of the Cleaner class initializes the whitelist. If the whitelist is not set up correctly, it could affect the validation process, leading to test failures.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 171,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'isSafeTag' method checks if a tag is safe according to the whitelist. If this method has a bug, it could incorrectly classify tags, leading to validation failures.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 168,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'addAttributes' method adds attributes to the whitelist. If attributes are not added correctly, it could affect the validation of documents that contain those attributes.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the likelihood that each method could directly impact the validation logic that the test is checking."
