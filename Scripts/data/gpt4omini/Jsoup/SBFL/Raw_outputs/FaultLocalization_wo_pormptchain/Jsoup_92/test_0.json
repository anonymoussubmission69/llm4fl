"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, the following methods are ranked from most to least suspicious regarding the failure of the test `retainsAttributesOfDifferentCaseIfSensitive`. The test is expected to retain the case of HTML attributes when parsed, but it appears to be failing due to incorrect attribute handling.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'defaultSettings' in 'HtmlTreeBuilder' returns the default parse settings. If the settings do not preserve case, it could lead to the observed failure where attributes are not retained in their original case.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'normalizeTag' in 'ParseSettings' normalizes the tag name based on the settings. If the settings are not configured to preserve case, this could affect how attributes are processed.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parseInput' in 'Parser' is responsible for parsing the HTML input. If it does not respect the case sensitivity settings, it could lead to incorrect attribute handling.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'process' in 'HtmlTreeBuilder' processes tokens and could be responsible for how attributes are handled during parsing. If it does not correctly handle case sensitivity, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'insert' in 'HtmlTreeBuilder' is responsible for inserting elements into the document. If it does not handle attributes correctly, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are identified as suspicious because they are directly involved in the parsing and handling of HTML attributes, which is the core functionality being tested in the failing test case."
