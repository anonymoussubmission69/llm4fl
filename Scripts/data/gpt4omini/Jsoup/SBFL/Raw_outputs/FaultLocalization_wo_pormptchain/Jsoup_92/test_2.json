"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are identified as suspicious. They are ranked from most to least suspicious based on their relevance to the failure observed in the test case.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'insert' in HtmlTreeBuilder is responsible for inserting elements into the document tree. Since the test is about dropping duplicate attributes, this method could be involved in how attributes are handled during insertion.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'normalizeAttributes' in ParseSettings is responsible for normalizing attributes, which is crucial when dealing with duplicate attributes. If this method does not handle normalization correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parseInput' in Parser is responsible for parsing the HTML input. If there are issues in how it processes the input, it could lead to incorrect handling of attributes.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getErrors' in Parser retrieves the list of parsing errors. If the error handling is not functioning correctly, it may not report duplicate attributes as expected.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are selected based on their direct involvement in the parsing and handling of HTML attributes, which is the core issue indicated by the test failure."
