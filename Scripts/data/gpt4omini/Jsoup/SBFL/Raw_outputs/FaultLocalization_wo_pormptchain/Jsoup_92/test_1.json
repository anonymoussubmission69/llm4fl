"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `dropsDuplicateAttributes` is failing due to an assertion error. The expected output does not match the actual output, indicating that there is likely an issue with how duplicate attributes are being handled in the parsing process.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 205,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'insert' in XmlTreeBuilder is responsible for inserting a new element into the document. It creates a new Element based on the start tag and normalizes its attributes. If duplicate attributes are not handled correctly here, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 206,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'insert' for Token.Character is responsible for inserting character nodes into the document. If character nodes are being treated as attributes or if there is a mismanagement of the node stack, it could affect how attributes are processed.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 201,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'process' in XmlTreeBuilder processes tokens and determines how to handle them. If the logic for handling start tags and attributes is flawed, it could lead to incorrect attribute handling.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 204,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'insertNode' is responsible for appending nodes to the current element. If there is an issue with how nodes are appended, it could affect the final structure of the document and lead to duplicate attributes.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parseInput' in Parser is responsible for initiating the parsing process. If the input is not being parsed correctly, it could lead to issues with how attributes are handled throughout the parsing.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the parsing and handling of attributes, particularly in the context of the failing test case."
