"Based on the provided test body and the stack trace, the test `testInvalidTableContents` is failing due to an assertion that checks if a certain text appears after a comment in the parsed HTML document. The failure indicates that the expected order of elements is not being maintained during parsing.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 250,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'load' in DataUtil is responsible for loading the HTML file and parsing it into a Document. If there is an issue with how the file is read or parsed, it could lead to incorrect document structure, causing the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 251,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parseByteData' is crucial as it converts the byte data into a Document using the specified parser. Any issues in this method could directly affect the structure of the Document, leading to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parseInput' in the Parser class is responsible for parsing the HTML input. If this method does not handle the input correctly, it could lead to incorrect parsing results, which is likely the cause of the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parse' in TreeBuilder is responsible for the actual parsing logic. If there are any issues in how it processes the tokens, it could lead to incorrect document structure, which is directly related to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the parsing process and their potential impact on the structure of the Document being tested."
