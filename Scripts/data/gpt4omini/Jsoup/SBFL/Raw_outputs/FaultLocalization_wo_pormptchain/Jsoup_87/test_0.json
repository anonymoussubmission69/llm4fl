"Based on the provided test case and the stack trace, the following methods are ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'normaliseWhitespace' is responsible for normalizing whitespace in the input string. Since the test case is failing due to an issue with whitespace handling in the HTML structure, this method is highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendNormalisedWhitespace' is called within 'normaliseWhitespace' and is responsible for appending normalized whitespace. It directly affects how whitespace is handled, making it a strong candidate for the fault.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parseInput' is responsible for parsing the HTML input. If there are issues with how the input is parsed, it could lead to incorrect HTML structure, which is evident in the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'settings' is used to set parsing settings, including whether to preserve case. If the settings are not correctly applied, it could lead to incorrect parsing behavior.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
