"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testByAttributeRegexCombined` is attempting to select elements using a CSS selector with a regex pattern that includes an unexpected token `=x|y]`. This indicates that the parsing of the selector is failing.\n2. The exception thrown is `Selector$SelectorParseException`, which suggests that the issue lies within the parsing logic of the selector.\n3. The stack trace shows that the error originates from the `findElements` method in the `Selector` class, which is responsible for parsing the selector string.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`findElements` (method_id: 28)**: This method is directly involved in parsing the selector and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`byAttribute` (method_id: 5)**: This method is called within `findElements` and is responsible for handling attribute selectors.\n- **`combinator` (method_id: 6)**: This method is involved in handling combinators in selectors, which may also affect how the selector is parsed.\n- **`select` (method_id: 26)**: This method is responsible for initiating the selection process and may be involved in how the selector is constructed.\n- **`select` (method_id: 20)**: This method is called on the `Element` class to perform the selection, which may also be relevant to the parsing logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [28, 5, 6, 26, 20]\n}\n```"
