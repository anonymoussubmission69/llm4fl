"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `handlesNestedImplicitTable` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` when comparing the expected and actual HTML output. The issue seems to be related to the handling of nested tables and the structure of the resulting HTML.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`siblingIndex()`** - This method is responsible for determining the index of a node among its siblings. If the index is incorrect, it could lead to improper nesting of elements.\n2. **`outerHtml(StringBuilder)`** - This method constructs the outer HTML representation of a node. If it does not handle nested structures correctly, it could lead to malformed HTML.\n3. **`html()`** - This method is responsible for generating the HTML of an element. If it does not correctly process child nodes, it could result in incorrect output.\n4. **`addChildToParent(Element child, boolean isEmptyElement)`** - This method adds a child element to a parent. If it does not correctly manage the parent-child relationship, it could lead to structural issues in the HTML.\n5. **`parseStartTag()`** - This method parses the start tag of an element. If it does not correctly identify the start of nested elements, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n6. **`parseEndTag()`** - This method handles the end tag of an element. If it does not correctly match the start tag, it could lead to unclosed or improperly nested elements.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 38, 37, 25]\n}\n```"
