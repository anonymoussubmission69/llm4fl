"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `caseSensitiveParseTree` is designed to check the parsing of HTML input while preserving the case of tags. The expected output is `<r> <X> A </X> <y> B </y> </r>`, but the actual output is `<r> <X> A <[y> B </y> </X]> </r>`. This indicates that there is an issue with how the parser handles the case sensitivity of tags.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `assertEquals` method in the JUnit framework, which suggests that the failure occurred during the comparison of the expected and actual output.\n\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include various methods in the `Parser` and `TreeBuilder` classes, which are responsible for parsing the HTML input and constructing the document object.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n- **Parser Class:**\n  - `parseInput(String html, String baseUri)` - This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML.\n  - `settings(ParseSettings settings)` - This method sets the parsing settings, which may affect case sensitivity.\n  \n- **TreeBuilder Class:**\n  - `parse(String input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors, ParseSettings settings)` - This method is responsible for the actual parsing logic.\n  - `processStartTag(String name)` - This method processes start tags, which is crucial for handling case sensitivity.\n  - `processEndTag(String name)` - This method processes end tags, which is also important for case handling.\n  - `insertStartTag(String startTagName)` - This method inserts a start tag into the document structure.\n  - `insertEndTag(String endTagName)` - This method inserts an end tag into the document structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe methods listed above are critical in the parsing process and may contain the fault leading to the test failure. They should be analyzed to determine how they handle case sensitivity and whether they are functioning as expected.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 22]\n}\n```"
