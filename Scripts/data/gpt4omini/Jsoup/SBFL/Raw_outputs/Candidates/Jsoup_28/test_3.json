"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `moreAttributeUnescapes` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The test is checking if the `href` attribute of an anchor element is correctly parsed from the provided HTML string. The expected value is `&wr_id=123&mid-size=true&ok=&wr`, but the actual value returned is `\u2240`, indicating a potential issue in the parsing logic.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in parsing and handling attributes:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Entities:loadEntities`** - This method is responsible for loading character entities, which may affect how special characters are parsed.\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method initiates the parsing of the HTML string, which is critical to the test.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method is responsible for the actual parsing logic, which could be where the error originates.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** - This method runs the parser and processes tokens, which is essential for correctly interpreting the HTML.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process`** - This method processes tokens and manages the state of the parsing, which is crucial for correctly handling the structure of the HTML.\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Node:attr`** - This method retrieves the attribute value, which is directly related to the test's assertion.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, leading to the incorrect parsing of the attribute.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3, 6, 10, 57]\n}\n```"
