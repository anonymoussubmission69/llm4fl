"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `handlesCustomProtocols` is designed to check the behavior of the `Jsoup.clean` method when handling custom protocols in HTML. The test fails because the expected output does not match the actual output.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `assertEquals` method, which compares the expected and actual cleaned HTML strings.\n3. The methods involved in the cleaning process include `Jsoup.clean`, `Cleaner.clean`, and `Parser.parseBodyFragment`, among others. These methods are responsible for parsing and cleaning the HTML input.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test that are suspicious and need further analysis include:\n\n- `org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 1)\n- `org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 2)\n- `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 4)\n- `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:clean(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 188)\n- `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I` (method_id: 189)\n\nThese methods are critical in the cleaning process and may contain the fault that leads to the discrepancy between the expected and actual results.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 4, 188, 189]\n}\n```"
