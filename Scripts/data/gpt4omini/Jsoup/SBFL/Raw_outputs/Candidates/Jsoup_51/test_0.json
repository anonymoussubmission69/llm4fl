"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSupportsNonAsciiTags` is failing because it expected to find the text \"Yes\" in the selected elements but found none. This indicates that the parsing of the HTML string containing non-ASCII characters is not functioning as expected.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If it fails to handle non-ASCII characters correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues in handling the input string could propagate to the final output.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)V`** - This method initializes the parsing process. If the input string is not correctly initialized or validated, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the parser. If there are issues in the tokenization or processing of the input string, it could result in the failure to find the expected elements.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;`** - This method reads tokens from the input string. If it fails to recognize or correctly process non-ASCII characters, it could lead to the absence of expected tokens in the output.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$Character:getData()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method retrieves the data from character tokens. If the character data is not being captured correctly, it could lead to the failure in the test.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is used to select elements based on a CSS query. If the elements are not being created correctly due to parsing issues, this method will not return the expected results.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 106, 121, 83]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be investigated further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
