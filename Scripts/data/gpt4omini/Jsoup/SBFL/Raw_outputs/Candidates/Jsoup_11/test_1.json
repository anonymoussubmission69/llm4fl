"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `notClass()` is attempting to parse a document using Jsoup and is specifically selecting elements with the query `div:not(.left)`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `SelectorParseException` is thrown due to an \"unexpected token\" in the query, which suggests that the parsing logic for the selector is failing.\n3. The methods involved in the parsing and selection process are critical to investigate, particularly those related to the `Selector` class and its methods.\n\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.findElements`** - This method is responsible for finding elements based on the selector query. It is directly involved in the parsing process that leads to the exception.\n2. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.select`** - This method is called to perform the selection based on the query and is likely where the parsing logic is executed.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue.consumeElementSelector`** - This method is responsible for consuming the element selector from the token queue, which is crucial for parsing the selector correctly.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue.matches`** - This method checks if the current position in the token queue matches a given sequence, which is essential for parsing logic.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue.consume`** - This method consumes a sequence from the token queue, which is also part of the parsing process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 23, 37, 34]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are likely to be the source of the fault due to their direct involvement in the parsing and selection process that led to the exception. Further investigation into these methods will help identify the root cause of the failure."
