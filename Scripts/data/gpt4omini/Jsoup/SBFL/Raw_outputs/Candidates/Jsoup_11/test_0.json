"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `notAll()` is attempting to parse an HTML document and select elements that are not `<p>` tags using the query `\":not(p)\"`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `SelectorParseException` is thrown, which suggests that there is an issue with parsing the selector query.\n3. The exception is thrown in the `findElements` method of the `Selector` class, which is called by the `select` method of the `Element` class.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.findElements`**: This method is directly involved in parsing the selector query and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.select`**: This method is called to perform the selection based on the query.\n- **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element.select`**: This method is the entry point for selecting elements from an `Element` based on a query.\n- **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue` methods**: These methods are responsible for handling the parsing of the query string, including `consume`, `matches`, and `consumeTagName`, which may be involved in the parsing logic.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following methods are identified as potentially suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 5, 6, 20, 22, 32, 43]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method IDs**:\n  - `2`: `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`\n  - `5`: `org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`\n  - `6`: `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consume()Ljava/lang/Character;`\n  - `20`: `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`\n  - `22`: `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseStartTag()V`\n  - `32`: `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeTagName()Ljava/lang/String;`\n  - `43`: `org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:matches(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the parsing error."
