"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testNotPretty` is designed to check the HTML output of a parsed document. It specifically tests the behavior of the `Jsoup.parse` method and the subsequent manipulation of the document's output settings.\n2. The failure occurs during the assertion that checks the HTML content of a `div` element. The expected output does not match the actual output, indicating a potential issue in how the HTML is being parsed or rendered.\n3. The stack trace points to the `assertEquals` method in the `ElementTest` class, which suggests that the problem lies in the methods responsible for generating the HTML output.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious for further analysis:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. Any issues here could lead to incorrect parsing.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method is called by `Jsoup.parse` and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. It is crucial to check if it handles the input correctly.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method initializes the parsing process. If there are issues in the initialization, it could affect the entire parsing outcome.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** - This method runs the parser and processes tokens. Any errors in token processing could lead to incorrect HTML structure.\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:html`** - This method is responsible for generating the HTML output of an element. If it does not correctly represent the internal structure, it could lead to mismatches in expected output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 73]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the test failure."
