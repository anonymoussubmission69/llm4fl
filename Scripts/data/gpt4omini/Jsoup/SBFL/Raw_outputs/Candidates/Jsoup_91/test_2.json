"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBinaryResultThrows` is designed to check if an `IOException` is thrown when a binary file is provided as input. The test expects the exception message to be \"Input is binary and unsupported\". The stack trace indicates that the assertion failed, which suggests that the expected exception was not thrown or the message was different.\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test include various methods from the `org.jsoup` library, particularly those related to parsing and handling connections. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:execute()`** - This method is responsible for executing the HTTP request. If the request does not handle binary data correctly, it could lead to the exception not being thrown as expected.\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:data(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)`** - This method is used to set the data for the request. If the data is not being set correctly, it could affect the execution.\n3. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:response()`** - This method retrieves the response from the executed connection. If the response handling does not account for binary data, it could lead to issues.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML. If it does not handle binary data correctly, it could lead to the exception not being thrown.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If it does not correctly identify binary data, it could lead to the failure of the test.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and affect the test outcome.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [238, 237, 239, 175, 124]\n}\n```"
