"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBinaryThrowsException` is designed to check if an `IOException` is thrown when trying to parse a binary file (in this case, a JPEG image). The test expects the exception message to be \"Input is binary and unsupported\". The failure indicates that the expected exception was not thrown, which suggests that the method responsible for parsing the file did not handle the binary input correctly.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/io/File;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 11)** - This method is responsible for parsing the file. If it does not correctly handle binary files, it could lead to the failure of the test.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:load(Ljava/io/File;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 165)** - This method is called within the `parse` method and is responsible for loading the file. If it does not validate the file type or handle binary files properly, it could also be a source of the issue.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;` (method_id: 126)** - This method is involved in reading the input and could be responsible for how the input is processed. If it does not handle binary data correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader:isEmpty()Z` (method_id: 106)** - This method checks if the reader is empty. If it does not account for binary data correctly, it could affect the parsing process.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader:consumeData()Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 116)** - This method consumes data from the reader. If it does not handle binary data properly, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [11, 165, 126, 106, 116]\n}\n```"
