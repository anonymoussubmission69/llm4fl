"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testKeepsPreTextAtDepth` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output when parsing HTML content. The expected text is `code\\n\\ncode`, but the actual output is `code code`, indicating that the whitespace is not being preserved correctly.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If there is an issue with how it handles whitespace, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues in this method could directly affect the output.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method is responsible for running the parser and processing tokens. If it does not handle whitespace tokens correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`** - This method processes tokens, including character tokens. If it does not correctly handle whitespace characters, it could result in the loss of whitespace in the output.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:text()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method retrieves the text content of an element. If it does not preserve whitespace correctly when constructing the text, it could lead to the observed discrepancy.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendNormalisedText(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/TextNode;)V`** - This method is responsible for appending normalized text to a StringBuilder. If it does not handle whitespace correctly, it could affect the final output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 12, 96, 97]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
