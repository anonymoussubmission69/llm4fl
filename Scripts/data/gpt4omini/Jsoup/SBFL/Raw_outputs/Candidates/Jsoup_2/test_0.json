"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `handlesTextAfterData` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual HTML output. The expected output contains a `<script>` tag followed by text, while the actual output has the text before the `<script>` tag. This suggests that there may be an issue with how the HTML is being parsed or how the text nodes are being handled.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in generating the HTML output:\n\n1. **`outerHtml(StringBuilder accum)`** in `DataNode` (method_id: 0) - This method is responsible for appending the data of the node to the output. If the data is not being escaped or handled correctly, it could lead to the observed issue.\n\n2. **`getWholeData()`** in `DataNode` (method_id: 1) - This method retrieves the data associated with the node. If the data is incorrect or not set properly, it could affect the output.\n\n3. **`outerHtml(StringBuilder accum)`** in `TextNode` (method_id: 6) - This method generates the HTML for a text node. If the whitespace handling or the order of appending is incorrect, it could lead to the output mismatch.\n\n4. **`html(StringBuilder accum)`** in `Element` (method_id: 15) - This method is responsible for generating the HTML for an element and its children. If the child nodes are not processed in the correct order, it could affect the final output.\n\n5. **`prependChild(Node child)`** in `Element` (method_id: 3) - This method adds a child node to the beginning of the child nodes list. If the order of child nodes is not maintained correctly, it could lead to the output being generated in the wrong order.\n\n6. **`parseTextNode()`** in `Parser` (method_id: 28) - This method is responsible for parsing text nodes. If the parsing logic is incorrect, it could lead to issues in how text nodes are created and appended.\n\n7. **`createFromEncoded(String encodedText, String baseUri)`** in `TextNode` (method_id: 29) - This method creates a text node from encoded text. If the encoding/decoding is not handled properly, it could lead to incorrect text being generated.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 6, 15, 3, 28, 29]\n}\n```"
