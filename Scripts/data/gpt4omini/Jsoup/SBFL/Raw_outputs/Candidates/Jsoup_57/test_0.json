"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testChainedRemoveAttributes` is attempting to remove an attribute from an HTML element using the `removeAttr` method.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `ConcurrentModificationException` occurred, which typically happens when a collection is modified while it is being iterated over.\n3. The exception is thrown from the `removeIgnoreCase` method in the `Attributes` class, which is called by the `removeAttr` method in the `Node` class.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:removeIgnoreCase`** - This method is responsible for removing an attribute from the collection and is where the exception is thrown.\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Node:removeAttr`** - This method calls `removeIgnoreCase` and is the entry point for the attribute removal operation.\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put`** - This method adds attributes to the collection and may be relevant if there are issues with how attributes are being managed.\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:iterator`** - This method provides an iterator for the attributes and could be involved in the concurrent modification issue.\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:remove`** - This method is used to remove an attribute from the collection and may also be relevant to the issue.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [61, 90, 60, 62, 61]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to understand the cause of the `ConcurrentModificationException` and to ensure that the attribute removal process is handled correctly without causing concurrent modifications."
