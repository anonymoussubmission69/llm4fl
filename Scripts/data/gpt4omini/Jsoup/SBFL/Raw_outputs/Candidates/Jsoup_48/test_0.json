"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `sameHeadersCombineWithComma` is failing because the expected value of the header \"Cache-Control\" is not matching the actual value returned by the `header` method in the `HttpConnection.Response` class. The expected value is \"no-cache, no-store\", but the actual value is \"no-cache\".\n\nThe relevant methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`processResponseHeaders(Map<String, List<String>> resHeaders)`**: This method is responsible for processing the response headers. It is crucial to check how it handles the \"Cache-Control\" header and whether it correctly combines multiple values.\n\n2. **`header(String name)`**: This method retrieves the value of a header by its name. It calls `getHeaderCaseInsensitive(name)`, which is also relevant to investigate.\n\n3. **`getHeaderCaseInsensitive(String name)`**: This method retrieves the header value in a case-insensitive manner. It is important to ensure that it correctly handles the retrieval of the \"Cache-Control\" header.\n\n4. **`header(String name, String value)`**: This method is used to set a header value. It is important to check if the header values are being set correctly when multiple values are provided.\n\n5. **`removeHeader(String name)`**: This method ensures that duplicate headers are not added. It is important to verify that it is functioning correctly to avoid issues with header values.\n\n6. **`scanHeaders(String name)`**: This method scans for headers and may affect how headers are processed and retrieved.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [11, 3, 6, 4, 5, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in processing and retrieving the header values, which are critical to the test's success."
