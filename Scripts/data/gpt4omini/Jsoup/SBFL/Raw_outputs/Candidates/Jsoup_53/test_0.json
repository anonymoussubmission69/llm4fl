"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `attributeWithBrackets` is attempting to parse an HTML string using Jsoup and is asserting that specific elements can be selected based on their attributes.\n2. The stack trace indicates a `SelectorParseException` occurred due to an unexpected token in the query `div[data='End]'`. This suggests that the parsing logic for the selector is failing when it encounters the closing bracket `]` in the attribute value.\n3. The methods involved in the parsing process include those in the `Jsoup`, `QueryParser`, and `Selector` classes, particularly those that handle the parsing of selectors and attributes.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method initiates the parsing process.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string.\n3. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse`** - This method parses the selector query.\n4. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:findElements`** - This method attempts to find elements based on the parsed query.\n5. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:byAttribute`** - This method handles the parsing of attributes in the selector.\n6. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:byTag`** - This method handles the parsing of tags in the selector.\n7. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:select`** - This method is called to select elements based on the query.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and the issue likely propagates through them, leading to the parsing error.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 154, 155, 157, 158, 151]\n}\n```"
