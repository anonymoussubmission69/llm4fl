"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `createsFormData` is failing because it expected the size of the form data to be 6, but it was actually 7. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the form data is being collected or processed.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.FormElement:formData()`** - This method is responsible for collecting the form data. Since the test is failing due to an unexpected size of the data, this method is the primary suspect.\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.FormElement:addElement(Element element)`** - This method adds elements to the form. If elements are being added incorrectly or if there are duplicates, it could lead to an incorrect size.\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.FormElement:hasAttr(String key)`** - This method checks if an element has a specific attribute. If the logic for determining whether an element should be included in the form data is flawed, it could lead to unexpected results.\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:attr(String key)`** - This method retrieves the value of an attribute. If the attributes are not being set or retrieved correctly, it could affect the form data.\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(String cssQuery)`** - This method selects elements based on a CSS query. If the selection logic is incorrect, it could lead to the inclusion of unexpected elements in the form data.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and affect the final output of the `formData()` method.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [280, 279, 112, 125, 132]\n}\n```"
