"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `booleanAttributeOutput` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output is `<img src=\"foo\" noshade nohref async autofocus=\"false\">`, while the actual output is `<img src=\"foo\" noshade=\"\" nohref async autofocus=\"false\">`. This indicates that there is an issue with how boolean attributes are being handled in the HTML output.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `outerHtml()` method of the `Element` class, which is responsible for generating the HTML representation of the element. The discrepancy in the output suggests that the handling of boolean attributes (like `noshade` and `async`) might not be functioning correctly.\n\n3. The methods involved in the parsing and rendering of the HTML include:\n   - `org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`\n   - `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`\n   - `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`\n   - `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml`\n   - `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtmlHead`\n   - `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtmlTail`\n   - `org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:html`\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n- `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml` (method_id: 80)\n- `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtmlHead` (method_id: 95)\n- `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtmlTail` (method_id: 96)\n- `org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:html` (method_id: 55)\n\nThese methods are directly related to the generation of the HTML output and are likely where the issue with boolean attributes is being introduced.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [80, 95, 96, 55]\n}\n```"
