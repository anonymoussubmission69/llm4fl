"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `mixCombinatorGroup` is failing because it expected the size of the selected elements to be 2, but it was actually 3. This indicates that there may be an issue with the way elements are being selected or parsed in the HTML string provided.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If there is an issue with the parsing logic, it could lead to incorrect element selection.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method is called by `Jsoup.parse` and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues here could directly affect the resulting Document.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method is part of the parsing process and is responsible for building the tree structure of the parsed document. If there are issues in how the tree is built, it could lead to incorrect element counts.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** - This method processes tokens and builds the document structure. If tokens are not processed correctly, it could lead to incorrect element counts.\n5. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:select`** - This method is responsible for selecting elements based on the provided CSS query. If the selection logic is flawed, it could lead to an incorrect number of elements being returned.\n6. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse`** - This method parses the query string and could potentially have issues that affect how elements are selected.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate through to others, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 143, 147]\n}\n```"
