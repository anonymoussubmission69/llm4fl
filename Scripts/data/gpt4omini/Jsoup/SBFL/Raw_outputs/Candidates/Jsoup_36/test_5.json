"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldNotThrowExceptionOnEmptyCharset` is designed to ensure that the method `getCharsetFromContentType` does not throw an exception when provided with certain input strings that represent content types with empty charset values.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalCharsetNameException` is thrown from the `Charset.checkName` method, which is called within the `getCharsetFromContentType` method when it attempts to check if the charset is supported.\n3. The `getCharsetFromContentType` method is directly responsible for the failure, as it processes the input and calls `Charset.isSupported(charset)`, which leads to the exception when the charset is invalid or empty.\n4. The static initializer of `DataUtil` is also covered, but it primarily initializes a pattern and does not directly contribute to the failure.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 1) - This method is directly responsible for the exception.\n- `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` (method_id: 0) - While not directly causing the failure, it initializes the pattern used in `getCharsetFromContentType`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0]\n}\n```"
