"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldSelectFirstCharsetOnWeirdMultileCharsetsInMetaTags` is asserting that the method `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType` should return \"ISO-8859-1\" when provided with a specific content type string.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalCharsetNameException` is thrown, which suggests that the method is attempting to validate or use a charset name that is not valid.\n3. The method `getCharsetFromContentType` is responsible for extracting and validating the charset from the content type string. It uses a regex pattern to find the charset and checks if it is supported using `Charset.isSupported(charset)`.\n4. The static initializer of `DataUtil` initializes a regex pattern, which is also relevant as it could affect how the charset is extracted.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType`: This method is directly involved in the failure and is responsible for extracting and validating the charset.\n- `DataUtil.<clinit>`: The static initializer may also be relevant as it sets up the regex pattern used in `getCharsetFromContentType`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
