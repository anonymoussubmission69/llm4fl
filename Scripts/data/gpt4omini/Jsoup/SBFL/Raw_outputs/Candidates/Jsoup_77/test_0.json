"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `normalizesDiscordantTags` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected HTML output with the actual output generated by the `Jsoup.parse` method. The expected output is `\"<div>\\ntest\\n</div>\\n<p></p>\"`, while the actual output is `\"<div>\\ntest\\n <p></p>\\n</div>\"`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with how the parser is handling whitespace or the structure of the HTML being parsed.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This is the entry point for parsing the HTML and is directly involved in generating the output that is being tested.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput`** - This method is responsible for processing the input HTML string and may contain logic that affects how whitespace is handled.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method is responsible for the actual parsing of the tokens and building the document structure, which could influence the final output.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read`** - This method reads the tokens from the input and could be responsible for how whitespace and tags are interpreted.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:insert`** - This method is responsible for inserting nodes into the document structure, which could affect how the final output is constructed.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 8, 117, 164]\n}\n```"
