"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `dropsDuplicateAttributes` is designed to check if duplicate attributes in an HTML element are handled correctly. The expected output is a normalized HTML string with unique attribute names, while the actual output contains multiple instances of the same attribute name.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs during the assertion of the expected output against the actual output generated by the `outerHtml()` method of the `Element` class.\n\n3. The methods involved in the parsing and handling of attributes are critical to investigate, especially those related to attribute normalization and the handling of duplicate attributes.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML string.\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml`** - This method generates the HTML representation of the element, which is where the output is being compared.\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:normalize`** - This method normalizes the attribute names, which is crucial for ensuring that duplicates are handled correctly.\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put`** - This method adds attributes to the element and may be involved in how duplicates are managed.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insert`** - This method is responsible for inserting elements into the tree structure, which may affect how attributes are processed.\n\n### JSON Output\nBased on the analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [15, 102, 87, 81, 36]\n}\n``` \n\nThis JSON object lists the method IDs that are likely to be involved in the fault, based on their roles in parsing, generating output, and managing attributes. Further investigation into these methods is recommended to identify the root cause of the test failure."
