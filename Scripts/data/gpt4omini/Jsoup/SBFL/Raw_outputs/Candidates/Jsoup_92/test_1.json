"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `dropsDuplicateAttributes` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output is a string representation of an HTML element with certain attributes, while the actual output includes additional attributes that should have been dropped.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML string. If there are issues with how attributes are handled during parsing, it could lead to the observed failure.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:insert`** - This method is involved in inserting nodes into the document tree. If it incorrectly handles attributes during insertion, it could result in duplicate attributes.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:popStackToClose`** - This method is responsible for closing tags and could potentially affect how attributes are finalized in the document.\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml`** - This method generates the outer HTML representation of an element, which is what is being compared in the test. If it does not correctly reflect the state of the element, it could lead to mismatches.\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put`** - This method is responsible for adding attributes to an element. If it does not handle duplicates correctly, it could lead to the observed issue.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [12, 204, 207, 64, 44]\n}\n```"
