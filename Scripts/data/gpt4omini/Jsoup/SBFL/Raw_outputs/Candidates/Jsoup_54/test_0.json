"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string. The test case is trying to parse an HTML string with invalid attribute names, which could lead to issues in parsing.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for initializing the parsing process. It may not handle invalid attribute names correctly.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)V`** - This method initializes the parsing process and validates the input. If the input is invalid, it could lead to exceptions.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the parser and processes tokens. If the tokens are not handled correctly due to invalid attributes, it could lead to errors.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom:fromJsoup(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;)Lorg/w3c/dom/Document;`** - This method converts a Jsoup document to a W3C document. If the Jsoup document has invalid attributes, this conversion could fail.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom$W3CBuilder:copyAttributes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;Lorg/w3c/dom/Element;)V`** - This method copies attributes from Jsoup nodes to W3C elements. If the attributes are invalid, it could throw an exception.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom$W3CBuilder:updateNamespaces(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method updates namespaces for elements. If the attributes are malformed, it could lead to issues in namespace handling.\n\nThe fault seems to propagate from the parsing of the HTML string to the conversion of the document, indicating that the methods involved in parsing and attribute handling are critical to investigate.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 182, 185, 188]\n}\n```"
