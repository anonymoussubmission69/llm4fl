"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testParsesSingleQuoteInContains` is expected to throw a `SelectorParseException`, but it instead throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with the message \"String must not be empty\". This indicates that there is a failure in the validation of a string input, likely related to the parsing logic in the `QueryParser` class.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the exception is thrown from the `Validate.notEmpty` method, which checks if a string is empty or null. This method is called in the `byTag` and `contains` methods of the `QueryParser` class. The failure in the test suggests that an empty string is being passed to these methods, which should not happen according to the validation logic.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notEmpty(Ljava/lang/String;)V` - This method is directly responsible for throwing the `IllegalArgumentException` when an empty string is passed.\n2. `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:byTag()V` - This method calls `Validate.notEmpty` and is involved in processing tag names.\n3. `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:contains(Z)V` - This method also calls `Validate.notEmpty` and is involved in processing the contains query.\n4. `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:findElements()V` - This method is responsible for finding elements and may lead to the invocation of `byTag` or `contains`, potentially passing an empty string.\n5. `org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;` - This method initiates the parsing process and may be the entry point where the empty string is introduced.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 9, 11, 10, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes methods that are directly involved in the validation and parsing process, which are likely contributing to the failure of the test."
