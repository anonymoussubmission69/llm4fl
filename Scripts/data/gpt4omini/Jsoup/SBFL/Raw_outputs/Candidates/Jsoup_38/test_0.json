"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `convertsImageToImg` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output is `\"<img />\\n<svg>\\n <image />\\n</svg>\"`, while the actual output is `\"<img />\\n<svg>\\n<im[g] />\\n</svg>\"`. This indicates that there is an issue with how the `<image>` tag is being processed and converted to `<img>`.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string. If there is an issue with how the parsing is done, it could lead to incorrect output.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method is called by `Jsoup.parse` and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues here could directly affect the output.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** - This method processes the tokens read from the input. If the tokenization is incorrect, it could lead to the wrong output.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process`** - This method processes tokens and is crucial for determining how tags are handled. If it incorrectly processes the `<image>` tag, it could lead to the observed failure.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If it fails to correctly identify the `<image>` tag, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit`** - This method emits tokens. If it emits the wrong token for the `<image>` tag, it could lead to the failure.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate through the others, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 3, 104, 105]\n}\n```"
