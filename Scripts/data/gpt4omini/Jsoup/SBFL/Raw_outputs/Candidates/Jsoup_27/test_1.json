"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCharset` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected charset \"utf-8\" with the actual result \"UTF-8\". This indicates that there is a potential issue in the method responsible for extracting and normalizing the charset from the content type.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is a static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is responsible for extracting the charset from the content type string.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- The `getCharsetFromContentType` method, as it directly relates to the failure in the test by returning the charset in uppercase, which does not match the expected lowercase charset.\n- The static initializer `<clinit>()` may also be relevant if there are issues with the pattern initialization, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure.\n\nThus, the potential suspicious method's ids are:\n- `1` for `getCharsetFromContentType`\n- `0` for the static initializer, though it is less likely to be the direct cause.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0]\n}\n```"
