"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testByClassCaseInsensitive` is failing because the expected size of elements selected by class name does not match the actual size. The assertion that failed indicates that the expected number of elements with the class \"Foo\" is 3, but only 1 was found.\n\nThe methods involved in the failure are primarily related to the parsing and selection of elements from the HTML string. The following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for the actual parsing logic.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method is responsible for building the tree structure of the parsed document.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process`** - This method processes tokens during parsing, which could affect how elements are recognized.\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select`** - This method is used to select elements based on the provided CSS query, which is critical for the test's assertion.\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:getIgnoreCase`** - This method retrieves attributes in a case-insensitive manner, which is relevant for class selection.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 12, 104, 57]\n}\n```"
