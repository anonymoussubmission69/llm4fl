The error message indicates that there was an unexpected token at the single quote in the query `div[data='End]'`.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. It is the entry point for parsing and could be where the input is first processed.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for initializing the parsing process. It could be relevant as it sets up the parsing context.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)V`** - This method initializes the parsing state and could be where the input is validated before parsing begins.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for the actual parsing of the input string and is critical in determining how the input is processed.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the parser and processes tokens. It is essential to understand how tokens are read and processed, especially in the context of the error.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:processStartTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This method processes start tags and could be relevant if the parsing logic for attributes is mishandled.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:processEndTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - Similar to the start tag processing, this method could also be relevant if the end tags are not handled correctly.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is called to select elements based on the CSS query. It is directly related to the failure since the query parsing is where the exception occurred.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 90]\n}\n```"

The test case `attributeWithBrackets` is attempting to select elements with specific data attributes that contain special characters, which seems to be causing the parsing issue.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the query string. Since the error is related to parsing, this method is critical to investigate.\n   \n2. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:findElements()V`** - This method is called during the parsing process to find elements based on the query. It handles various cases, including attributes, and could be where the parsing logic fails.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:byAttribute()V`** - This method specifically deals with attribute selectors. Given that the test is trying to select elements based on attributes with special characters, this method is likely involved in the failure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is the entry point for selecting elements based on a query. It initializes the `Selector` with the query and root element, making it relevant to the parsing process.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V`** - The constructor for the `Selector` class, which sets up the query and root element. Any issues in initialization could lead to parsing errors.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [152, 155, 158, 151, 150]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the parsing exception and to ensure that the query parsing logic can handle special characters in attribute selectors correctly."
