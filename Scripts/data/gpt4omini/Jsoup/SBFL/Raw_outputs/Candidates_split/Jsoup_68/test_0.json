The test `testHandlesDeepSpans` is designed to check if the HTML parsing correctly counts the number of `<span>` and `<p>` tags after appending a large number of `<span>` tags to a `StringBuilder`.\n2. The stack trace indicates a `StackOverflowError`, which typically occurs due to excessive recursion or deep nesting in method calls.\n3. The error originates from the `HtmlTreeBuilder` class, specifically in methods like `inSpecificScope`, `inScope`, and `inButtonScope`, which suggests that the parsing logic is likely encountering an infinite loop or excessive recursion when processing the deeply nested `<span>` tags.\n\nNext, I will analyze the covered methods by the failed test to identify which methods might be suspicious and could lead to the fault.\n\n### Suspicious Methods\n1. **HtmlTreeBuilder.inSpecificScope** - This method is involved in determining the current scope of the HTML parsing and is likely contributing to the recursion.\n2. **HtmlTreeBuilder.inScope** - Similar to `inSpecificScope`, this method is also related to scope management during parsing.\n3. **HtmlTreeBuilder.inButtonScope** - This method checks if the current context is within a button scope, which may also be contributing to the recursion.\n4. **Tokeniser.read** - This method is responsible for reading tokens from the input, and if it doesn't handle the deeply nested structure correctly, it could lead to excessive recursion.\n5. **TokeniserState.read** - This method processes the current token and transitions states, which could also be a source of the recursion issue.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe methods listed above are likely candidates for further investigation to identify the root cause of the `StackOverflowError`. They are involved in the parsing logic that handles the deeply nested HTML structure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [120, 121, 122, 123, 113]\n}\n``` \n\nThis JSON object includes the method IDs of the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further to find the fault in the system under test."
