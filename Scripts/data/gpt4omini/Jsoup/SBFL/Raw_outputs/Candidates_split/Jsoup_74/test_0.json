Since the test is checking the normalized text output, any issues in this method could directly affect the test result.\n   \n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendNormalisedText(StringBuilder, TextNode)`** - This method is involved in appending normalized text to a StringBuilder. If there are issues in how invisible characters are handled here, it could lead to the discrepancies observed in the test.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:preserveWhitespace(Node)`** - This method checks if whitespace should be preserved for a given node. If it incorrectly determines whether to preserve whitespace, it could affect the normalization process.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:childNodeSize()`** - This method returns the size of child nodes. If the child nodes are not being processed correctly, it could lead to incorrect text normalization.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:ensureChildNodes()`** - This method ensures that child nodes are initialized.

If the character set is not set correctly, it could lead to issues in how characters are represented in the output.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Entities:isBaseNamedEntity(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This method checks if a given name corresponds to a base named entity. If this method fails to recognize certain entities, it could lead to incorrect character representations.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader:consumeData()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method consumes data from the character reader.
