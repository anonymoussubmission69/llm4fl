Since the test is focused on handling invalid attribute names, any issues in parsing could lead to the observed error.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - Similar to the above, this method is part of the parsing process and could be where the invalid attribute handling is failing.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)V`** - This method initializes the parsing process and validates the input. If the input is not handled correctly, it could lead to the `INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR`.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the actual parsing logic. If there are issues with how tokens are processed, it could lead to the error being thrown.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`** - This method processes tokens during parsing. If it does not correctly handle invalid tokens or attributes, it could result in the observed error.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notNull(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This method is used to validate that objects are not null. If any of the attributes being processed are null when they shouldn't be, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Node:hasAttr(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This method checks if a node has a specific attribute. If it does not handle invalid attribute names correctly, it could contribute to the error.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 64, 72]\n}\n```"

The stack trace indicates that the error occurs during this conversion process, specifically when handling attributes.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom.W3CBuilder.copyAttributes` (Method ID: 187)**: This method is responsible for copying attributes from a Jsoup node to a W3C element. The error message indicates that an invalid character is being set as an attribute, which suggests that this method may be mishandling attribute names.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom.W3CBuilder.head` (Method ID: 185)**: This method processes the head of the document and may also be involved in setting attributes. Given the context of the error, it could be relevant to investigate how it interacts with attributes.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute.<init>` (Method ID: 136)**: This constructor validates the key and value of an attribute. If the key contains invalid characters, it could lead to the `INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR` exception.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Entities.loadEntities` (Method ID: 101)**: This method loads entities from a file and may be indirectly related to how attributes are processed, especially if any entity names are being used as attribute keys.\n\nThe following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [182, 187, 185, 136, 101]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the fault."
