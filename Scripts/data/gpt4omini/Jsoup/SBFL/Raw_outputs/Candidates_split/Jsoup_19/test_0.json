The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `Jsoup.clean` method with a `Whitelist` that includes custom protocols.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is responsible for cleaning the HTML input based on the provided whitelist. Since the test is failing during the cleaning process, this method is a primary suspect.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This is an overloaded version of the clean method that calls the other clean method with an empty base URI. It is also relevant to the test failure.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called within the clean method to parse the body fragment of the HTML. If there is an issue with how the body is parsed, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method is responsible for running the parser. If there are issues in how the parser processes the tokens, it could affect the output.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`** - This method processes tokens during parsing. Any issues in token processing could lead to incorrect HTML being generated.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]\n}\n```"

The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `Jsoup.clean` method with custom protocols added to the whitelist.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure occurs at the assertion comparing the expected and actual cleaned HTML strings. The suspicious methods that could be leading to this fault are primarily related to the `Jsoup.clean` method and the handling of protocols in the `Whitelist` class.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:tag()`** - This method retrieves the tag of the element, which may affect how the element is processed during cleaning.\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendChild(Node child)`** - This method adds a child node to the element, which could influence the structure of the HTML being cleaned.\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:preserveWhitespace()`** - This method checks if whitespace should be preserved, which could affect the output of the cleaned HTML.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tag:valueOf(String tagName)`** - This method retrieves a tag by its name, which is crucial for understanding how tags are processed.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tag:isSelfClosing()`** - This method checks if a tag is self-closing, which could impact how the HTML is rendered after cleaning.\n\nThese methods are critical in understanding how the HTML is being parsed and cleaned, and any issues in their implementation could lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [50, 52, 54, 69, 71]\n}\n```"

The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `Jsoup.clean` method when handling custom protocols in HTML.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure occurs at the assertion comparing the expected and actual cleaned HTML strings. The relevant part of the test is the line where `Jsoup.clean` is called with the `Whitelist.basicWithImages().addProtocols(...)` method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `CharacterReader` and `Tokeniser` classes, which are responsible for parsing and tokenizing the input HTML. The methods that are most likely to be suspicious and warrant further investigation are those that deal with the handling of tokens and attributes, as they directly relate to how the HTML is processed.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods identified for further analysis:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()`** - This method is responsible for reading tokens from the input. If it does not correctly handle custom protocols, it could lead to the observed failure.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)`** - This method emits tokens. If it incorrectly emits tokens for custom protocols, it could cause the output to differ from expectations.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emitTagPending()`** - This method finalizes and emits a pending tag. If the tag handling is incorrect, it could lead to malformed HTML output.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$Tag:appendAttributeValue(Ljava/lang/String;)`** - This method appends attribute values to tags. If it does not handle custom protocol values correctly, it could affect the final output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [108, 109, 115, 136]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to determine if they are contributing to the failure of the test by not correctly processing the custom protocols in the HTML input."

The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `Jsoup.clean` method with custom protocols added to the whitelist.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed are primarily related to the `Whitelist` class and its methods, as they are responsible for defining which tags and attributes are allowed during the cleaning process. The following methods are particularly relevant:\n\n1. **`addProtocols`** - This method is responsible for adding custom protocols to the whitelist. If there is an issue with how protocols are added or validated, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n2. **`isSafeAttribute`** - This method checks if an attribute is safe based on the protocols defined. If it incorrectly identifies an attribute as safe or unsafe, it could affect the output.\n3. **`testValidProtocol`** - This method tests if a given attribute value starts with a valid protocol. If this method fails to correctly validate the protocols, it could lead to the wrong output being generated.\n4. **`getEnforcedAttributes`** - This method retrieves attributes that are enforced for a specific tag. If the enforced attributes are not correctly applied, it could also lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods and the reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [170, 172, 173, 174]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in determining how the input HTML is processed and cleaned, and any faults in their implementation could directly lead to the test failure observed."
