The failure occurred while parsing the query `\":not(p)\"`, indicating that this method may not be handling certain queries correctly.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V` (method_id: 3)**: This constructor initializes a Selector object with a query and a root element. If the query is malformed or not supported, it could lead to parsing issues.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;` (method_id: 5)**: This static method also selects elements based on a query and a root element. Similar to method 2, it could be involved in the failure if the query is not handled properly.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeTagName()Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 32)**: This method consumes a tag name from the token queue. If the token queue is not in the expected state due to a malformed query, it could lead to issues.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:matches(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 43)**: This method checks if the token queue matches a given sequence. If the matching logic is flawed, it could contribute to the parsing failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 3, 5, 32, 43]\n}\n```"

            "output": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the failure occurred due to a `SelectorParseException` when trying to parse the query `':not(p)'`. This indicates that the issue is likely related to the parsing logic in the `Selector` class.\n\nThe covered methods that might be suspicious and relevant to the failure are primarily those in the `org.jsoup.select.Selector` class, particularly the methods involved in parsing and selecting elements. However, the provided covered methods do not directly include the `Selector` methods, but they do include methods from the `Tag` class which may indirectly affect the parsing behavior.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Selector.findElements** - This method is responsible for finding elements based on the selector query. Since the failure is related to parsing a selector, this method is critical to investigate.\n2. **Selector.select** - This method is likely involved in executing the selection logic after parsing the query. It should be examined to understand how it handles the parsed query.\n3. **Element.select** - This method is called as part of the selection process and may also contribute to the failure if it does not handle the parsed query correctly.\n\nGiven that the failure is specifically related to parsing a selector, the methods in the `Tag` class may not be directly responsible for the fault, but they could influence how tags are treated during selection.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [182, 111, 84]  // Assuming these are the IDs for Selector.findElements, Selector.select, and Element.select respectively\n}\n``` \n\n(Note: The method IDs for `Selector.findElements`, `Selector.select`, and `Element.select` are assumed based on their typical usage in the context of the failure. The actual IDs should be verified against the source code.)"
