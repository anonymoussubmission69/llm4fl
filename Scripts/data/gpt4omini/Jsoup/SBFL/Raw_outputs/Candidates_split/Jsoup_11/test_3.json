This indicates that there is an issue with the parsing logic in the `Selector` class, particularly in how it handles the `:not` pseudo-class.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V`** - This constructor initializes the `Selector` with a query and a root element. It is crucial to check how the query is processed during initialization.\n   \n2. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is responsible for selecting elements based on the query. It directly relates to the failure since it is invoked with the problematic query.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This static method also selects elements based on a query and a root element. It is important to see how it handles the parsing of the query.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeElementSelector()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method consumes the element selector from the token queue. It is essential to analyze how it processes selectors, especially those with pseudo-classes like `:not`.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:matches(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This method checks if the current position in the token queue matches a given string. It is relevant to understand how it validates the tokens being parsed.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 2, 5, 23, 47]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical to understanding the parsing logic and identifying the root cause of the `SelectorParseException`."

The stack trace indicates that the error occurs in the `org.jsoup.select.Selector.findElements` method, which is called when the test attempts to select elements using the provided query.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.findElements`** - This method is directly involved in parsing the selector and is where the exception is thrown.\n2. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.select`** - This method is called by `findElements` and is part of the selection process.\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element.select`** - This method is also involved in the selection process and may contribute to the issue.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser.parseAttribute`** - This method is responsible for parsing attributes, which may be relevant if the selector parsing involves attributes.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue.consumeAttributeKey`** - This method is used to consume the attribute key during parsing, which could be related to the parsing error.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [182, 128, 84, 104, 105]\n}\n``` \n\nHere, the method IDs correspond to the methods identified as suspicious based on their involvement in the selector parsing process and the exception thrown during the test execution."
