The assertion failure indicates that the expected error message was not returned.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and may be suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil:isBlank(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This method checks if a string is blank. If the input is not handled correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior when processing the binary file.\n   \n2. **`org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil:isWhitespace(I)Z`** - This method checks if a character is whitespace. Similar to the above, if the binary data is misinterpreted as whitespace, it could cause issues.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notNull(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This method validates that an object is not null. If the input to this method is null when it shouldn't be, it could lead to an exception.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:htmlParser()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Parser;`** - This method initializes the HTML parser. If the parser is not set up correctly for binary data, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse(Ljava/io/Reader;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/Parser;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input. If it does not handle binary data correctly, it could lead to the IOException being thrown.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 3, 14, 17]\n}\n```"

The assertion failure indicates that the expected error message was not returned, which suggests that the methods involved in handling the input and parsing it may be faulty.\n\nThe covered methods that are potentially suspicious and need further analysis include:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader:<init>(Ljava/io/Reader;I)V`** - This constructor initializes the `CharacterReader` with a `Reader` object. If the input is not handled correctly, it could lead to issues when reading binary data.\n   \n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader:bufferUp()V`** - This method is responsible for buffering the input. If it does not correctly handle binary data, it could lead to the `IOException` not being thrown as expected.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If it does not correctly identify the binary data, it may not trigger the expected exception.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:parseInputStream(Ljava/io/InputStream;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/Parser;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input stream. If it does not correctly handle the binary input, it could lead to the failure of the test.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:detectCharsetFromBom(Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;)Lorg/jsoup/helper/DataUtil$BomCharset;`** - This method detects the charset from the BOM. If it incorrectly processes the binary data, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [100, 103, 124, 163, 165]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to determine if they are correctly handling binary input and throwing the appropriate exceptions when necessary."

If there is an issue with how the request is processed, it could lead to the wrong exception being thrown or not being thrown at all.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:response()`** - This method retrieves the response from the executed connection. If the response handling is incorrect, it could affect the parsing of the response and lead to the failure of the test.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Response:parse()`** - This method parses the response body. If the parsing logic does not correctly handle binary data, it could result in an unexpected behavior, leading to the test failure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Response:setupFromConnection()`** - This method sets up the response from the connection.
