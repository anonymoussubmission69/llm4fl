    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `handlesCustomProtocols` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output when cleaning HTML with custom protocols. The test is specifically checking the behavior of the `Jsoup.clean` method with a `Whitelist` that includes custom protocols.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is responsible for cleaning the HTML input based on the provided whitelist. Since the test is failing during the cleaning process, this method is a primary suspect.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This is an overloaded version of the clean method that calls the other clean method with an empty base URI. It is also relevant to the test failure.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called within the clean method to parse the body fragment of the HTML. If there is an issue with how the body is parsed, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method is responsible for running the parser. If there are issues in how the parser processes the tokens, it could affect the output.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`** - This method processes tokens during parsing. Any issues in token processing could lead to incorrect HTML being generated.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]\n}\n```"
