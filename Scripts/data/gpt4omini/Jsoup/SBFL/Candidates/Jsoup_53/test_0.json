    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the failure occurred due to a `SelectorParseException` when trying to parse a CSS query with brackets in the attribute selector. The error message indicates that there was an unexpected token at the single quote in the query `div[data='End]'`.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. It is the entry point for parsing and could be where the input is first processed.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for initializing the parsing process. It could be relevant as it sets up the parsing context.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)V`** - This method initializes the parsing state and could be where the input is validated before parsing begins.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for the actual parsing of the input string and is critical in determining how the input is processed.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the parser and processes tokens. It is essential to understand how tokens are read and processed, especially in the context of the error.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:processStartTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This method processes start tags and could be relevant if the parsing logic for attributes is mishandled.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:processEndTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - Similar to the start tag processing, this method could also be relevant if the end tags are not handled correctly.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is called to select elements based on the CSS query. It is directly related to the failure since the query parsing is where the exception occurred.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 90]\n}\n```"
