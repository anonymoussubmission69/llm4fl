The failure occurred while parsing the query `\":not(p)\"`, indicating that this method may not be handling certain queries correctly.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V` (method_id: 3)**: This constructor initializes a Selector object with a query and a root element. If the query is malformed or not supported, it could lead to parsing issues.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;` (method_id: 5)**: This static method also selects elements based on a query and a root element. Similar to method 2, it could be involved in the failure if the query is not handled properly.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeTagName()Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 32)**: This method consumes a tag name from the token queue. If the token queue is not in the expected state due to a malformed query, it could lead to issues.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:matches(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 43)**: This method checks if the token queue matches a given sequence. If the matching logic is flawed, it could contribute to the parsing failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 3, 5, 32, 43]\n}\n```"
