    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `notClass()` is attempting to parse a document using Jsoup and is specifically selecting elements with a CSS selector `div:not(.left)`.\n2. The error thrown is `SelectorParseException`, indicating that there is an issue with parsing the selector, specifically an \"unexpected token\" at `:not(.left)`.\n3. The stack trace points to the `Selector.findElements` method as the source of the error, which suggests that the parsing logic for CSS selectors is where the fault may lie.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V` (method_id: 3)**: This constructor initializes the Selector with a query and root element. It is crucial to check how the query is processed.\n- **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;` (method_id: 5)**: This method is responsible for selecting elements based on the query. It directly relates to the parsing of the selector.\n- **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeElementSelector()Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 23)**: This method consumes the element selector from the token queue. It is important to verify how it handles the `:not` pseudo-class.\n- **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:matches(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 47)**: This method checks if the current token matches a given string. It may be involved in the parsing logic that leads to the exception.\n- **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeTagName()Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 36)**: This method consumes a tag name from the token queue, which may be relevant if the selector parsing is incorrectly handling tag names.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 5, 23, 47, 36]\n}\n```"
