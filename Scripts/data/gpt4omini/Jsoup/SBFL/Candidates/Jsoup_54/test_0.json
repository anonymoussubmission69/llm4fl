    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string. Since the test is focused on handling invalid attribute names, any issues in parsing could lead to the observed error.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - Similar to the above, this method is part of the parsing process and could be where the invalid attribute handling is failing.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)V`** - This method initializes the parsing process and validates the input. If the input is not handled correctly, it could lead to the `INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR`.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the actual parsing logic. If there are issues with how tokens are processed, it could lead to the error being thrown.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`** - This method processes tokens during parsing. If it does not correctly handle invalid tokens or attributes, it could result in the observed error.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notNull(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This method is used to validate that objects are not null. If any of the attributes being processed are null when they shouldn't be, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Node:hasAttr(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This method checks if a node has a specific attribute. If it does not handle invalid attribute names correctly, it could contribute to the error.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 64, 72]\n}\n```"
