    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testKeepsPreTextAtDepth` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output is `code\\n\\ncode`, but the actual output is `code[ ]code`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with how the HTML is being parsed, particularly with handling whitespace or newlines within `<pre>` tags.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in parsing the HTML and constructing the document:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This is the entry point for parsing HTML strings.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string and may have issues with whitespace handling.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(Ljava/io/Reader;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseSettings;)V`** - This method initializes the parsing process and sets up the necessary parameters.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the parser and processes tokens, which could be where the whitespace handling is failing.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`** - This method processes tokens and could be responsible for how whitespace and newlines are treated during parsing.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 12]\n}\n```"
