    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is failing because the expected HTML structure does not match the actual output. The main issue seems to be related to how the document is being normalized, particularly with the handling of text nodes and the overall structure of the HTML.\n\n2. The `normalise` method (ID 100) is responsible for normalizing the document structure, but it has a complex conditional structure that may skip important normalization steps. This could lead to incorrect document structure.\n\n3. The `normaliseTextNodes` method (ID 101) is incomplete and does not seem to handle text nodes correctly, which is crucial for the expected output.\n\n4. The `html` method (ID 14) builds the string representation of the document, but if the structure is incorrect due to previous methods, it will lead to incorrect output.\n\n5. The `outerHtmlHead` (ID 17) and `outerHtmlTail` (ID 18) methods handle the opening and closing tags, respectively. If these methods do not correctly reflect the structure of the document, they could contribute to the issues, but they are less likely to be the primary cause.\n\n6. The `normaliseWhitespace` method (ID 37) is important for formatting but is the least likely to cause structural issues.\n\n### Proposed Fixes\n\n1. **Method ID 100 - `normalise`**:\n   - Ensure that the normalization process is comprehensive and does not skip any important elements. The method should check for the presence of `head`, `body`, and `html` elements and normalize them accordingly.\n   - **Fix**: Modify the method to ensure that all necessary elements are normalized without skipping any.\n\n2. **Method ID 101 - `normaliseTextNodes`**:\n   - Complete the implementation to handle text nodes properly. Ensure that text nodes are moved or processed as needed.\n   - **Fix**: Implement logic to handle text nodes correctly, ensuring they are normalized and placed in the correct position within the document.\n\n3. **Method ID 14 - `html`**:\n   - Ensure that the `html` method correctly reflects the normalized structure. This method should be called after all normalization processes are complete.\n   - **Fix**: Verify that the `html` method is called after the normalization methods to ensure it reflects the latest structure.\n\n4. **Method ID 17 - `outerHtmlHead`** and **Method ID 18 - `outerHtmlTail`**:\n   - Review the logic for handling attributes and indentation to ensure that they are correctly applied based on the document structure.\n   - **Fix**: Ensure that these methods correctly handle the opening and closing tags based on the normalized structure.\n\n5. **Method ID 37 - `normaliseWhitespace`**:\n   - While this method is less likely to be the cause, ensure that it is functioning correctly to maintain proper formatting.\n   - **Fix**: Confirm that whitespace normalization is applied consistently throughout the document.\n\n### ReRanked Methods\n\nBased on the analysis and proposed fixes, the new ranking of suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 100,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 17,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
