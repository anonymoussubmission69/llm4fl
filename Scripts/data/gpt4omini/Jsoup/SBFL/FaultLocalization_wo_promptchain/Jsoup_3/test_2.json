    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and the stack trace, the test `testPrependRowToTable` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected HTML output with the actual output after prepending a row to a table. The most relevant method that is likely causing this issue is the `prepend` method in the `Element` class, as it is directly responsible for modifying the HTML structure.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'prepend' method is responsible for adding new content to the beginning of the element.
