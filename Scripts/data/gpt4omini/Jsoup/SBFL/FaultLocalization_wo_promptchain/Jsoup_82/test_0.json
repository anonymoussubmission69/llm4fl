    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `fallbackToUtfIfCantEncode` is failing because it expected the charset to be `UTF-8`, but it was `ISO-2022-CN`. The test is designed to ensure that if a specified charset cannot be used, the system should default to `UTF-8`.\n\nThe suspicious methods involved in this failure are primarily related to the parsing and charset handling. Here are the methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 251,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'load' in DataUtil is responsible for loading the document from an InputStream with a specified charset.
