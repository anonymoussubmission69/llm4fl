    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `createsFormData` is failing because it expected the size of the form data to be 6, but it was actually 7. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the method that generates the form data.\n\nThe suspicious methods that could potentially contain the fault, ranked from most to least suspicious, are as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 280,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'formData()' in the FormElement class is responsible for collecting the form data.
