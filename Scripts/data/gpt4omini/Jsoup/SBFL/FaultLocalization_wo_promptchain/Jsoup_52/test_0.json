    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `testDetectCharsetEncodingDeclaration` is failing because it expected the charset to be `ISO-8859-1`, but it was actually `UTF-8`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the charset is being detected or set in the parsing process.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 176,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parseByteData' is responsible for parsing the byte data and determining the charset.
