    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `preservesSpaceInTextArea` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output is `One\\n\\tTwo\\n\\tThree`, while the actual output is `One[ Two ]Three`. This indicates that there is an issue with how whitespace is being handled in the parsing of the `<textarea>` element.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 65,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'preserveWhitespace' determines if whitespace should be preserved based on the tag and its parent.

The first method is the most suspicious as it directly determines whether whitespace is preserved, which is the core issue in the failing test."
