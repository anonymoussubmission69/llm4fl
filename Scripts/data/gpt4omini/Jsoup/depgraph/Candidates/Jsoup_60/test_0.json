    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testParsesSingleQuoteInContains` is expected to throw a `SelectorParseException`, but it instead throws an `IllegalArgumentException` due to an empty string being passed to the `notEmpty` validation method. This indicates that there is a failure in the logic that processes the input string, particularly in the `QueryParser` methods.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:contains(Z)V`** - This method calls `Validate.notEmpty(searchText, \":contains(text) query must not be empty\")`, which is where the exception is thrown if `searchText` is empty.\n2. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:findElements()V`** - This method calls `contains(false)`, which leads to the `contains` method where the empty string issue arises.\n3. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse()Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;`** - This method orchestrates the parsing process and may be responsible for how the input is handled before reaching the `contains` method.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:unescape(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is involved in processing the input string and could potentially return an empty string if not handled correctly.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:chompBalanced(CC)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is responsible for extracting balanced strings and could also lead to an empty string if the input is malformed.\n6. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notEmpty(Ljava/lang/String;)V`** - This method is directly responsible for throwing the `IllegalArgumentException` when the string is empty.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 22]\n}\n```"
