    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNormalisesStructure` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual HTML output. The error indicates that the expected output has a `<noscript></noscript>` tag, while the actual output has a `<body>` tag instead.\n\nThe methods that are likely involved in this issue are those related to the normalization of the document structure, particularly the `normalise()` method and any methods that deal with the `<head>` and `<body>` elements. \n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed:\n\n1. **`normalise()`** - This method is responsible for normalizing the document structure, which is directly related to the test case.\n2. **`head()`** - This method retrieves the `<head>` element, which is part of the document structure.\n3. **`body()`** - This method retrieves the `<body>` element, which is also part of the document structure.\n4. **`findFirstElementByTagName(String tag, Node node)`** - This method is used to find elements by their tag name, which may be involved in the normalization process.\n5. **`normaliseTextNodes(Element element)`** - This method normalizes text nodes within an element, which could affect the output structure.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 4, 10, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test case."
