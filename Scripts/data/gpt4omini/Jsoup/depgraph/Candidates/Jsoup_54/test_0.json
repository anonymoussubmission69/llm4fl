The error indicates that an invalid character is being used in an attribute, which suggests that this method may not be handling certain characters correctly.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom$W3CBuilder:head`** - This method is involved in building the W3C DOM from a Jsoup document. It calls `copyAttributes`, which is where the error is likely propagating from.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom:fromJsoup`** - This method converts a Jsoup document to a W3C document. It calls `convert`, which in turn calls `head`, making it a part of the call chain leading to the error.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.helper.W3CDom:convert`** - This method is responsible for traversing the Jsoup document and converting it to a W3C document. It calls `head`, which is where the error occurs.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:hasAttr`** - This method checks if an element has a specific attribute. The error may be related to how attributes are being validated or processed.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:hasKey`** - This method checks if a specific key exists in the attributes. It may be involved in the validation of attribute keys.\n\nThe error message indicates an issue with an invalid character in an attribute, which suggests that the methods involved in attribute handling and conversion between document types are critical to investigate.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 0, 1, 2, 43, 152]\n}\n```"
