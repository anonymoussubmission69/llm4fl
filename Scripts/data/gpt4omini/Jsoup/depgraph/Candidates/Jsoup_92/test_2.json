    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;` (method_id: 3)** - This method is responsible for adding attributes to an element. Since the test is about handling duplicate attributes, this method could be involved in the issue.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:normalize()V` (method_id: 52)** - This method normalizes the attribute names, which is relevant to the test case that expects attributes to be normalized to lowercase.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 24)** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML input. If there are issues in how it handles attributes, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insert(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token$StartTag;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;` (method_id: 23)** - This method inserts a start tag into the tree builder. If it does not handle duplicate attributes correctly, it could lead to the test failure.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z` (method_id: 36)** - This method processes tokens, which includes handling start tags and attributes. It is crucial for the parsing logic.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilderState$7:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;Lorg/jsoup/parser/HtmlTreeBuilder;)Z` (method_id: 2)** - This method processes tokens in a specific state of the HTML tree builder. It could be involved in how attributes are processed.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:setTrackErrors(I)Lorg/jsoup/parser/Parser;` (method_id: 1)** - This method sets the error tracking for the parser. If errors are not tracked correctly, it could lead to incorrect parsing results.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:generateImpliedEndTags(Ljava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 77)** - This method generates implied end tags, which could affect how the document structure is built and how attributes are handled.\n\n9. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insertNode(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)V` (method_id: 19)** - This method inserts a node into the tree. If it does not handle nodes with duplicate attributes correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n10. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)V` (method_id: 15)** - This method emits tokens during parsing. If it does not handle attribute tokens correctly, it could lead to issues in the final output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 52, 24, 23, 36, 2, 1, 77, 19, 15]\n}\n```"
