The test failure indicates that the expected normalized text does not match the actual output, suggesting that this method may not be handling invisible characters correctly.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendNormalisedText(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/TextNode;)V` (method_id: 1)**: This method is involved in appending normalized text to a StringBuilder. Since the test is concerned with text normalization, any issues in this method could directly affect the output.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.TextNode:getWholeText()Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 9)**: This method retrieves the whole text of a TextNode. If the text is not being retrieved correctly, it could lead to discrepancies in the final output.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:preserveWhitespace(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Z` (method_id: 4)**: This method checks if whitespace should be preserved. If it incorrectly determines whether to preserve whitespace, it could lead to unexpected text normalization results.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.StringUtil:appendNormalisedWhitespace(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;Ljava/lang/String;Z)V` (method_id: 43)**: This method is responsible for appending normalized whitespace. If it does not handle whitespace correctly, it could affect the final text output.\n\nThe test failure indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output due to issues with text normalization, particularly with invisible characters. Therefore, the methods listed above are critical to investigate further.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 9, 43]\n}\n```"
