    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addProtocols`** - This method is directly involved in adding protocols to the whitelist, which is crucial for the test case that checks if certain protocols are preserved in the cleaned HTML. If this method does not correctly handle the addition of protocols, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes`** - This method is responsible for copying safe nodes from the source to the destination. If it fails to correctly identify or copy nodes based on the whitelist, it could result in the expected output not matching the actual output.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:createSafeElement`** - This method creates a safe element based on the source element. If it does not correctly enforce the attributes or handle the creation of elements, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeAttribute`** - This method checks if an attribute is safe based on the protocols defined. If it incorrectly identifies an attribute as safe or unsafe, it could affect the cleaning process.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeTag`** - Similar to `isSafeAttribute`, this method checks if a tag is safe. If it fails to recognize a tag as safe, it could lead to the removal of necessary attributes or tags.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean`** - This is the entry point for cleaning the HTML. If there are issues in how it orchestrates the cleaning process, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:clean`** - This method is responsible for the actual cleaning of the document. Any issues here could directly affect the output of the cleaning process.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 29, 4]\n}\n```"
