Any issues in parsing could lead to incorrect document structure.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader:matchConsume`** - This method checks for matches in the character stream. If it fails to correctly consume characters, it could lead to parsing errors.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilderState$24:process`** - This method processes tokens in the HTML tree builder state.
