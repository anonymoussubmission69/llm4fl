If it does not correctly account for newlines, it could also lead to the observed issue.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Token)`** - This method processes tokens and transitions the state of the tree builder. If it mishandles newline tokens, it could affect the overall text representation.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilderState:isWhitespace(Token)`** - This method checks if a token is whitespace. If it incorrectly identifies newlines as whitespace, it could lead to the wrong text being generated.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:generateImpliedEndTags()`** - This method generates implied end tags, which could affect how the document structure is built and thus impact the text output.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 21, 22, 43, 40]\n}\n```"
