"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testIsValidDocument` is failing because the `isValid` method is expected to return `true` for a valid document and `false` for an invalid one. The stack trace indicates that the assertion for the invalid document is failing, which suggests that the logic in the `isValid` method or its dependencies may not be functioning correctly.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The isValid method is directly responsible for determining if a document is valid. It checks if the number of discarded nodes is zero. If this method fails, it directly affects the test results.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The copySafeNodes method is called within isValid and is responsible for copying safe nodes from the source document to the destination. If it incorrectly counts the number of discarded nodes, it will lead to incorrect validation results.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The head method processes nodes and determines if they are safe based on the whitelist. If it incorrectly identifies safe tags or attributes, it could lead to an incorrect count of discarded nodes.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The createSafeElement method creates a safe element and counts discarded attributes. If it fails to correctly identify safe attributes, it could affect the validation process.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 37,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The isSafeTag method checks if a tag is safe based on a predefined list. If the list is incorrect or not comprehensive, it could lead to invalid documents being considered valid.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The body method retrieves the body element of the document. While it is less likely to be the source of the problem, if it fails to find the body, it could lead to issues in the validation process.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 134,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The relaxed method creates a new Whitelist instance. This method is less likely to be the source of the problem as it does not directly affect document validation logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
