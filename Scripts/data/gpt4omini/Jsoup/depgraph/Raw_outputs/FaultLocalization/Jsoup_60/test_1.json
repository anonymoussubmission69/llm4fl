"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test is expecting a `SelectorParseException` but is instead encountering an `IllegalArgumentException` due to an empty string being passed to the `notEmpty` method. This indicates that there is a failure in the logic that should prevent empty strings from being processed.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'byAttribute' calls 'Validate.notEmpty(key)', which throws an IllegalArgumentException if 'key' is empty. Since the test fails due to an unexpected IllegalArgumentException, this method is highly suspicious as it directly relates to the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'notEmpty' method is responsible for throwing the IllegalArgumentException when an empty string is passed. Since the test fails because of this exception, this method is also very suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'parse' method processes the token queue and calls 'findElements'. If 'findElements' does not handle empty strings correctly, it could lead to the IllegalArgumentException being thrown. This makes it suspicious as well.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'consumeSubQuery' method processes the token queue but does not directly handle the empty string case. However, if it leads to an empty key being passed to 'byAttribute', it could indirectly cause the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'chompBalanced' method is responsible for consuming balanced characters but does not seem to directly relate to the empty string issue. It is less suspicious compared to the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'consumeToAny' method is used to consume characters until a match is found. It does not seem to directly relate to the empty string issue, making it less suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'consumeElementSelector' method processes element selectors but does not seem to be related to the empty string issue at all. It is the least suspicious method.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
