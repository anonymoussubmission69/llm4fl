"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test is expecting a `SelectorParseException` but is instead encountering an `IllegalArgumentException` due to an empty string being passed to the `notEmpty` method. This indicates that there is a failure in the logic that should ensure a non-empty string is being processed.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'contains' method calls 'TokenQueue.unescape' which is expected to return a non-empty string. If it returns an empty string, it will trigger the 'notEmpty' validation, leading to an IllegalArgumentException. This method is directly involved in the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'parse' method creates a new QueryParser and calls its parse method. If the query is malformed or empty, it could lead to the exception being thrown. This method is responsible for initiating the parsing process.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'findElements' method is responsible for determining how to parse elements based on the token queue. If it does not correctly handle the ':contains' case, it could lead to an empty string being passed to 'contains'.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'parse' method processes the token queue and calls 'findElements'. If the token queue is not handled correctly, it could lead to an empty string being passed to 'contains'.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'chompBalanced' method is responsible for handling balanced characters. While it is not directly related to the exception, if it fails to correctly process input, it could indirectly affect the parsing logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'unescape' method is used to process strings but does not seem to be directly related to the exception being thrown. It is less suspicious compared to others.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'notEmpty' method is simply a validation method that throws an exception if the string is empty. It is not suspicious itself but indicates that something upstream is passing an empty string.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
