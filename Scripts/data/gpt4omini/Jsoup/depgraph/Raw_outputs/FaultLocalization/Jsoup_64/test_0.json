"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output has a properly formatted `<meta>` tag, while the actual output has the `<meta>` tag incorrectly formatted with HTML entities. This suggests that there may be an issue with how the HTML is being parsed or how the tags are being handled.\n\nNow, I will rank the methods based on their potential involvement in this issue:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method handles the insertion of start tags and has a specific case for self-closing tags. If the handling of the <meta> tag is incorrect, it could lead to the observed formatting issue in the output.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for inserting empty elements and checks for self-closing tags. If the <meta> tag is being treated as self-closing incorrectly, it could lead to the output being formatted with HTML entities.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method handles raw text and transitions the tokeniser state. If the raw text handling is not correctly implemented, it could affect how tags are processed, including <meta> tags.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method processes tokens and handles specific tags, including <meta>. If the logic for handling <meta> is flawed, it could contribute to the formatting issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method processes tokens and handles the <html> start tag. While it is less directly related to the <meta> tag, any issues in the overall token processing could affect the final output.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method processes tokens and handles the <head> start tag. It is the least suspicious in relation to the <meta> tag issue, as it does not directly handle the <meta> tag itself.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
