The test case is failing due to an 'IllegalCharsetNameException', which indicates that the method is attempting to validate a charset name that is not properly formatted. The test input 'text/html; charset=charset=iso-8859-1' contains a duplicate 'charset=' which is likely causing the regex matcher to fail in extracting a valid charset. This makes the method highly suspicious as it directly relates to the failure in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
