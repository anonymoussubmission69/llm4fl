"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testIsValid` is failing due to an assertion that checks if the HTML is valid according to a whitelist. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when the `assertTrue` method is called, suggesting that the method being tested is returning `false` when it should return `true`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the method bodies to identify potential issues:\n\n1. **Method 1 (`isValid`)**: This method is responsible for validating the HTML content against a whitelist. It parses the HTML and uses a `Cleaner` to check validity. If this method fails, it could lead to the test failing.\n\n2. **Method 0 (`isValid` with Document)**: This method checks if a `Document` is valid by ensuring that no nodes are discarded during the cleaning process. If nodes are discarded, it indicates that the HTML is not valid, which could directly cause the test to fail.\n\n3. **Method 3 (`copySafeNodes`)**: This method copies safe nodes from one element to another. If it incorrectly identifies nodes as safe or fails to copy them properly, it could lead to a situation where valid HTML is deemed invalid.\n\n4. **Method 2 (`testValidProtocol`)**: This method checks if a given attribute's value starts with a valid protocol. If it fails to recognize a valid protocol, it could lead to attributes being discarded incorrectly.\n\n5. **Method 5 (`isSafeAttribute`)**: This method checks if an attribute is safe based on its tag and protocols. If it incorrectly identifies an attribute as unsafe, it could lead to the test failing.\n\n6. **Method 7 (`isTrue`)**: This method is a utility that asserts a boolean condition. It is less likely to be the source of the problem since it simply checks a condition.\n\n7. **Method 14 (`isSafeTag`)**: This method checks if a tag is safe. While it is important, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure compared to the other methods.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method validates the HTML content against a whitelist.
