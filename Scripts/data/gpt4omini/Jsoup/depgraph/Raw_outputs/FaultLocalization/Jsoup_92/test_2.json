"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test is failing due to an issue with handling duplicate attributes in HTML parsing. The expected output is not matching the actual output, indicating that the parser is not correctly normalizing or handling duplicate attributes.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods and their suspiciousness ranking:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The normalize method is responsible for normalizing attribute names to lower case. If this method does not correctly handle duplicates or fails to normalize properly, it could lead to the parser retaining multiple attributes with the same name, which is the core issue in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The put method modifies the values of attributes. If it does not handle the case where an attribute already exists (i.e., duplicates), it could lead to incorrect attribute values being stored, contributing to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 24,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The parseInput method is the entry point for parsing HTML. If this method does not correctly invoke normalization or handle duplicate attributes, it could lead to the observed failure. However, it is less suspicious than the normalization and put methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The insert method handles the insertion of start tags. If it does not properly check for existing attributes before inserting, it could lead to duplicates. However, it is less directly related to the failure than the normalization and put methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The process method handles token processing.
