"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method `byTag` (ID: 2)**: This method consumes an element selector and checks if it is not empty. The issue in the test is related to parsing a selector with `:not`, which is not handled in this method. The method does not account for pseudo-classes like `:not`, which is likely causing the parsing error.\n\n2. **Method `Selector` constructor (ID: 1)**: This constructor validates the query and root element. The test failure indicates a problem with the query parsing, particularly with the `:not` pseudo-class. This method is crucial as it initializes the `TokenQueue` with the query, which is directly related to the parsing issue.\n\n3. **Method `select` (ID: 5)**: This method creates a new `Selector` instance and calls its select method. While it is indirectly related to the failure, it does not directly handle the parsing logic, making it less suspicious than the previous methods.\n\n4. **Method `consumeElementSelector` (ID: 10)**: This method reads from a token queue and returns a substring. It does not directly relate to the parsing error in the test, but it could contribute to issues if the tokenization is incorrect. However, it does not seem to be the primary cause of the failure.\n\n5. **Method `notEmpty` (ID: 6)**: This method checks if a string is null or empty. It does not relate to the parsing of selectors or the specific error in the test, making it the least suspicious method.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **For `byTag` (ID: 2)**: Modify the method to handle pseudo-classes like `:not`. This could involve adding a check for the presence of `:` in the tag name and implementing logic to parse it correctly.\n  \n- **For `Selector` constructor (ID: 1)**: Ensure that the constructor can handle queries with pseudo-classes. This may involve enhancing the validation logic to account for valid pseudo-class syntax.\n\n- **For `select` (ID: 5)**: No changes are necessary, but ensure that it correctly utilizes the updated `Selector` constructor.\n\n- **For `consumeElementSelector` (ID: 10)**: Review the tokenization logic to ensure it can handle selectors with pseudo-classes.\n\n- **For `notEmpty` (ID: 6)**: No changes are necessary as it is not related to the issue.\n\n### ReRanked Methods:\nBased on the analysis, the new ranking of suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
