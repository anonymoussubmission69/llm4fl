"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the parsing exception is caused by the query `\":not(p)\"`, which is not being handled correctly in the `Selector` class. The methods are ranked based on their direct involvement with the query parsing logic.\n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 1 (Constructor of Selector)**:\n   - The constructor validates the query and root element. If the query is malformed or empty, it could lead to parsing issues. The validation checks are present, but if the query is not valid according to the expected format, it could still lead to exceptions later in the parsing process.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Enhance the validation to include checks for valid query syntax before proceeding with the parsing.\n\n2. **Method ID 3 (Static select method)**:\n   - This method creates a new `Selector` instance and calls its `select` method. If the query passed to it is invalid, it will lead to the same parsing exception seen in the test.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add a pre-validation step for the query before creating the `Selector` instance to ensure it adheres to expected formats.\n\n3. **Method ID 82 (Instance select method)**:\n   - This method calls the static `select` method of the `Selector` class with the current element as the root. It is less suspicious since it relies on the correctness of the query and the `Selector` class.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Similar to Method ID 3, implement a check for the query's validity before calling the static method.\n\n4. **Method ID 4 (notEmpty method)**:\n   - This method checks if a string is empty or null but does not handle the query directly. It is less relevant to the parsing issue since it does not directly interact with the `Selector` or the query parsing logic.\n   - **Potential Fix**: This method could be improved by throwing an exception or returning a specific error message if the string is empty or null, but it is not directly related to the parsing issue.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods:\n\nAfter analyzing the methods and their potential fixes, the ranking remains the same as the initial assessment since the constructor and the static select method are still the most suspicious due to their direct involvement with the query parsing.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 82,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
