"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the parsing exception occurs due to an unexpected token in the query `p:not([id=1])`. This indicates that the issue is likely related to how the query is being processed and validated in the methods.\n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 1 (Constructor of Selector)**:\n   - This method validates the query and root element. If the query is malformed or empty, it could lead to parsing issues. The test fails due to a parsing exception, making this method highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Method ID 5 (Select Method)**:\n   - This method creates a new Selector instance and calls its select method. If the query passed to it is invalid, it will propagate the issue. Given the parsing error in the test, this method is also very suspicious.\n\n3. **Method ID 10 (Consume Element Selector)**:\n   - This method consumes an element selector from the token queue. If the token queue is not properly formatted or encounters unexpected tokens, it could lead to parsing errors. This makes it somewhat suspicious, but less so than the first two methods.\n\n4. **Method ID 2 (By Tag Method)**:\n   - This method attempts to consume a tag name from the token queue and validates it. If the tag name is empty, it could lead to issues, but it is less directly related to the parsing error in the test compared to the previous methods.\n\n5. **Method ID 6 (Not Empty Validation)**:\n   - This method checks if a string is not empty or null. While it is important for validation, it does not directly relate to the parsing error in the test case, making it the least suspicious.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n\n- **Method ID 1**: Ensure that the query is not only non-empty but also properly formatted before proceeding with the parsing. Consider adding regex validation for the query format.\n  \n- **Method ID 5**: Add error handling to catch exceptions from the Selector constructor and provide meaningful feedback if the query is invalid.\n\n- **Method ID 10**: Implement additional checks to ensure that the tokens being consumed are valid and handle unexpected tokens gracefully.\n\n- **Method ID 2**: Ensure that the tag name consumed is valid and provide a fallback or error message if it is not.\n\n- **Method ID 6**: This method is already simple and effective; no changes are necessary.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods:\n\nGiven the analysis and potential fixes, the re-ranking of methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
