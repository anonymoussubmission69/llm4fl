"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method ID 0 (DocumentType Constructor)**:\n   - The constructor of `DocumentType` is invoked with an empty string for the `name` parameter. This directly leads to the `IllegalArgumentException` being thrown because it calls the `notEmpty` method to validate the `name`.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Modify the test to ensure that a valid non-empty string is passed to the `DocumentType` constructor. Alternatively, the constructor could be modified to handle empty strings more gracefully, perhaps by providing a default value or throwing a more descriptive exception.\n\n2. **Method ID 1 (notEmpty Method)**:\n   - This method checks if the string is empty or null and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. While it is involved in the failure, it is not the direct cause since it is a utility function used for validation.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes are necessary for this method as it correctly validates the input. However, it could be beneficial to add more context to the exception message to indicate which parameter failed validation.\n\n### Re-Ranking\nGiven the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n- Method ID 0 is still the most suspicious because it is the direct cause of the test failure.\n- Method ID 1 is less suspicious as it is a utility function and not the direct cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
