"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method `getCharsetFromContentType` (method_id: 0)**:\n   - The method is responsible for extracting the charset from a content type string.\n   - The test is failing due to an `IllegalCharsetNameException`, which indicates that the method is trying to validate a charset that is not supported.\n   - The current logic does not handle cases where the charset string may contain additional characters (like a comma), which can lead to an invalid charset name.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Modify the method to handle cases where the charset string may contain additional characters. This can be done by ensuring that only valid charset names are extracted and validated.\n\n   **Revised Method**:\n   ```java\n   static String getCharsetFromContentType(String contentType) {\n       if (contentType == null) return null;\n       Matcher m = charsetPattern.matcher(contentType);\n       if (m.find()) {\n           String charset = m.group(1).trim();\n           // Remove any additional characters after the first valid charset\n           charset = charset.split(\",\")[0].trim();\n           if (Charset.isSupported(charset)) return charset;\n           charset = charset.toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH);\n           if (Charset.isSupported(charset)) return charset;\n       }\n       return null;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Method `charsetPattern` (method_id: 1)**:\n   - This method is a static final pattern used for matching charset in content type strings.\n   - The pattern itself seems to be correctly defined for extracting charset values.\n   - It does not directly cause the exception, but it is crucial for the functionality of `getCharsetFromContentType`.\n   - **No changes needed**.\n\n### Re-Ranking\nAfter analyzing the methods and their potential fixes, the ranking remains the same since `getCharsetFromContentType` is still the most suspicious due to the direct cause of the exception.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
