"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the failure occurs because the expected output for the `systemId` is not being generated correctly in the `outerHtml` method. The `outerHtmlHead` method is responsible for constructing the output, and it appears that the `systemId` is not being appended correctly.\n\n### Method Analysis:\n1. **Method ID 0 (`outerHtmlHead`)**: This method constructs the outer HTML for a DocumentType. The issue seems to be that the `systemId` is not being appended correctly. The line `accum.append(' ').append(attr(\"systemId\")).append(\"\\\"\");` is likely the culprit, as it does not handle the case where `systemId` is blank properly.\n   \n   **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the `systemId` is appended correctly. The line should be modified to check if `systemId` is not blank before appending it.\n\n2. **Method ID 2 (`outerHtml`)**: This method calls `outerHtmlHead` and returns its string representation. It is indirectly affected by the issues in `outerHtmlHead`.\n\n3. **Method ID 1 (Constructor)**: This initializes the DocumentType with the provided parameters. If the `publicId` or `systemId` are not set correctly, it could lead to issues in `outerHtmlHead`. However, it is less suspicious than `outerHtmlHead`.\n\n4. **Method ID 16 (`attr`)**: This method sets an attribute in the DocumentType. It could affect the `publicId` or `systemId`, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure.\n\n5. **Method ID 8 (`isBlank`)**: This is a utility method that checks if a string is blank. It does not directly relate to the output generation of the DocumentType and is the least suspicious.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Suggested Fix for Method ID 0:\n```java\nvoid outerHtmlHead(StringBuilder accum, int depth, Document.OutputSettings out) {\n    accum.append(\"<!DOCTYPE html\");\n    if (!StringUtil.isBlank(attr(\"publicId\"))) {\n        accum.append(\" PUBLIC \\\"\").append(attr(\"publicId\")).append(\"\\\"\");\n    }\n    if (!StringUtil.isBlank(attr(\"systemId\"))) {\n        accum.append(\" SYSTEM \\\"\").append(attr(\"systemId\")).append(\"\\\"\"); // Ensure SYSTEM is included\n    }\n    accum.append('>');\n}\n```\n\nThis fix ensures that the `systemId` is correctly prefixed with \"SYSTEM\" when it is not blank, which aligns with the expected output format for a DocumentType declaration."
