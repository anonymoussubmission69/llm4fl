"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 1: `appendNormalisedText`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is responsible for normalizing text from `TextNode` objects. The test failure indicates that invisible characters are not being normalized correctly. The method calls `preserveWhitespace` and `appendNormalisedWhitespace`, which are critical in determining how text is processed.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method correctly identifies and handles invisible characters before appending normalized text. This may involve adding checks for specific invisible character codes and ensuring they are not appended to the `StringBuilder`.\n\n2. **Method ID 0: `text`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method traverses nodes and calls `appendNormalisedText` for `TextNode` instances. If there are issues in how nodes are traversed or how text is accumulated, it could lead to the observed test failure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Review the traversal logic to ensure that all `TextNode` instances are processed correctly and that no invisible characters are skipped. Consider adding logging to track which nodes are being processed.\n\n3. **Method ID 43: `appendNormalisedWhitespace`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is involved in appending normalized whitespace. If it fails to correctly identify or handle invisible characters, it could lead to the observed test failure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Enhance the logic to specifically check for invisible characters and decide whether to append them based on the context. This may involve modifying the `isActuallyWhitespace` method to account for invisible characters.\n\n4. **Method ID 4: `preserveWhitespace`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method determines whether whitespace should be preserved based on the parent node. If it incorrectly decides to preserve whitespace when it shouldn't, it could contribute to the test failure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Review the logic to ensure it accurately reflects the intended behavior regarding whitespace preservation. Consider adding more conditions to handle different node types and their whitespace rules.\n\n5. **Method ID 9: `getWholeText`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method simply returns the core value of a node. It is less likely to be the source of the problem since it does not perform any normalization or manipulation of the text.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes are necessary for this method as it is not directly involved in the normalization process.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods\nAfter analyzing the methods and their potential fixes, the re-ranked list of suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 43,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
