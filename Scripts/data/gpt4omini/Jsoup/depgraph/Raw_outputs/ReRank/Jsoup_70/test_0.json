"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is failing because the expected output is not matching the actual output. The expected output is `code\\n\\ncode`, but the actual output is `code[ ]code`, indicating that whitespace handling is not functioning as intended.\n\n2. The `appendNormalisedText` method is critical because it directly appends normalized text from a `TextNode`, and it relies on the `preserveWhitespace` method to determine if whitespace should be preserved. If this logic fails, it could lead to incorrect text being returned.\n\n3. The `text` method is responsible for traversing nodes and appending normalized text. If it does not correctly handle the text nodes or elements, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected output.\n\n4. The `preserveWhitespace` method is essential as it determines if whitespace should be preserved based on the element's tag. If this method incorrectly evaluates the condition, it could affect how text is processed in the `appendNormalisedText` method.\n\n5. The `appendNormalisedWhitespace` method handles whitespace normalization but is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure compared to the methods that directly handle text nodes and their properties.\n\n6. The `getWholeText` method simply returns the core value of a text node and does not involve any complex logic that could lead to the observed test failure.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **For `appendNormalisedText`:** Ensure that the logic for appending normalized text correctly handles cases where whitespace should be preserved. This may involve checking the parent node's properties more thoroughly.\n  \n- **For `text`:** Verify that the traversal logic correctly identifies and processes all relevant text nodes and elements. Ensure that it correctly accumulates text without losing whitespace.\n\n- **For `preserveWhitespace`:** Review the logic to ensure that it accurately reflects the intended behavior for different node types and their parents.\n\n- **For `appendNormalisedWhitespace`:** While this method is less suspicious, ensure that it correctly handles leading and trailing whitespace as expected.\n\n- **For `getWholeText`:** This method seems fine as it simply returns the core value, but ensure that the `coreValue()` method is functioning correctly.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
