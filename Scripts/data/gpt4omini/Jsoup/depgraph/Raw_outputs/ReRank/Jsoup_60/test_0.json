"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is expecting a `SelectorParseException` but is receiving an `IllegalArgumentException` instead. This indicates that the parsing logic is failing due to an empty string being passed to the `notEmpty` validation.\n2. The `contains` method is directly responsible for calling `TokenQueue.unescape`, which is expected to return a non-empty string. If it returns an empty string, it will trigger the `notEmpty` validation, leading to the `IllegalArgumentException`.\n3. The `parse` method initializes the parsing process and could be responsible for malformed queries.\n4. The `findElements` method is responsible for determining how to parse elements based on the token queue, which could lead to an empty string being passed to `contains`.\n5. The `chompBalanced` method is indirectly related as it processes input but is not directly responsible for the exception.\n6. The `unescape` method processes strings but does not seem to be directly related to the exception being thrown.\n7. The `notEmpty` method is a validation method that throws an exception if the string is empty, indicating that something upstream is passing an empty string.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **Method 0 (`contains`)**: Ensure that `TokenQueue.unescape` does not return an empty string. Add a check after calling `unescape` to handle empty strings gracefully.\n  \n  ```java\n  String searchText = TokenQueue.unescape(tq.chompBalanced('(', ')'));\n  if (searchText.isEmpty()) {\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\":contains(text) query must not be empty\");\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Method 9 (`parse`)**: Validate the input query before parsing to ensure it is not empty or malformed.\n\n  ```java\n  public static Evaluator parse(String query) {\n      if (query == null || query.trim().isEmpty()) {\n          throw new SelectorParseException(\"Query must not be empty\");\n      }\n      QueryParser p = new QueryParser(query);\n      return p.parse();\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **Method 1 (`findElements`)**: Ensure that the logic for handling `:contains` is robust and does not lead to an empty string being passed to `contains`.\n\n- **Method 2 (`parse`)**: Similar to method 9, ensure that the token queue is not empty before calling `findElements`.\n\n- **Method 4 (`chompBalanced`)**: Ensure that the method correctly handles cases where the input is empty or malformed.\n\n- **Method 3 (`unescape`)**: Ensure that the method correctly processes escape characters and does not return an empty string.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\nAfter analyzing the methods and their potential fixes, the new ranking of suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
