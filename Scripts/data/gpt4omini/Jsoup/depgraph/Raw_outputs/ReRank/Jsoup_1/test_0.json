"Based on the analysis of the test case and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 47 - `normalise`**:\n   - **Issue**: The method is responsible for moving text nodes to the body of the document. The test failure indicates that the order of text nodes is incorrect, suggesting that this method may not be handling the text nodes properly.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the text nodes are appended in the correct order. Instead of appending them all at once after removing them, consider maintaining their order during the move.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 1.\n\n2. **Method ID 1 - `parse`**:\n   - **Issue**: This method is crucial for parsing the document and normalizing it. If it does not correctly handle the parsing of the input string, it could lead to incorrect document structure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the `parseTextNode()` method is correctly implemented to handle text nodes and that the normalization is called at the right time.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 2.\n\n3. **Method ID 2 - `parseStartTag`**:\n   - **Issue**: This method handles the start tags in the document. If it fails to correctly identify or process the start tags, it could lead to incorrect document structure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method correctly identifies and processes all start tags, and that it properly handles cases where the tag is not valid.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 3.\n\n4. **Method ID 0 - `addChildToParent`**:\n   - **Issue**: This method is responsible for adding child elements to their parent. While it is important for document structure, it does not directly manipulate text nodes.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method correctly handles the addition of child elements, especially in cases where the child is a text node.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 4.\n\n5. **Method ID 20 - `popStackToSuitableContainer`**:\n   - **Issue**: This method is used to find a suitable parent for a tag. While it is important for maintaining the document structure, it does not directly affect the text node ordering.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method correctly identifies the last suitable container for the tag.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 5.\n\nBased on the analysis, the ranking remains the same as the original ranking provided. Here is the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
