"It seems that there are no method bodies available for the provided method IDs. However, based on the test case and the stack trace, we can analyze the issue.\n\n### Analysis of the Test Case\nThe test case `testSupportsNonAsciiTags` is designed to check if the Jsoup library can correctly parse and select elements with non-ASCII characters in their tags. The test fails because the expected output is \"Yes\", but the actual output is an empty string.\n\n### Potential Issues\n1. **Parsing Non-ASCII Characters**: The Jsoup parser may not be handling non-ASCII characters correctly, which could lead to the selection returning no elements.\n2. **Selector Syntax**: The selector used (`\"\u00e9\u0080\u00b2\u00e6\u008d\u0097\u00e6\u008e\u00a8\u00e7\u00a7\u00bb\u00e3\u0082\u00b0\u00e3\u0083\u00a9\u00e3\u0083\u0095\"`) might not be correctly formatted or recognized by Jsoup.\n\n### Potential Fixes\n1. **Check Jsoup Version**: Ensure that the version of Jsoup being used supports non-ASCII characters in tags. If not, consider updating to a newer version.\n2. **Encoding**: Ensure that the input string is correctly encoded. If the input string is not in UTF-8, it may lead to parsing issues.\n3. **Selector Validation**: Validate the selector syntax to ensure it is correctly formatted for Jsoup.\n\n### Re-Ranking\nSince we do not have specific method IDs to analyze, we cannot provide a re-ranking. However, based on the analysis, the methods related to parsing and selecting elements in Jsoup would be the most suspicious.\n\n### JSON Output\nGiven the lack of method IDs, the output will reflect that we could not find any methods to rank:\n\n```json\n[]\n```"
