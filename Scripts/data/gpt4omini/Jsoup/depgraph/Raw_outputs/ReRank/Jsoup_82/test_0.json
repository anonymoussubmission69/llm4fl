"It appears that there are no method bodies available for the provided method IDs. However, based on the test and stack trace information, we can analyze the issue.\n\n### Analysis of the Test and Stack Trace\n\nThe test `fallbackToUtfIfCantEncode()` is designed to ensure that if a specific charset (in this case, `ISO-2022-CN`) cannot be encoded, the system should fall back to using `UTF-8`. The test fails because it expected the charset to be `UTF-8`, but it received `ISO-2022-CN` instead.\n\n### Potential Fix\n\n1. **Charset Handling**: The method responsible for parsing the HTML input should be modified to check if the specified charset can be encoded. If it cannot, it should default to `UTF-8`.\n\n2. **Update the Parsing Logic**: Ensure that the parsing logic in the method that handles the charset correctly identifies when to switch to `UTF-8`.\n\n### Suggested JSON Output\n\nSince there are no method IDs to rank, we will provide a placeholder output indicating that no methods were found, but we have identified a potential fix.\n\n```json\n[]\n``` \n\nIf you have specific method IDs or additional context, please provide them for further analysis."
