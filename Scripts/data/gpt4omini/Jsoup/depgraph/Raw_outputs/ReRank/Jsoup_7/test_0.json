"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Test Analysis**: The test `testNormalisesStructure` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output has a specific structure, while the actual output has an incorrect nesting of elements, particularly with the `<body>` tag.\n\n2. **Method Analysis**:\n   - **normalise()**: This method is responsible for normalizing the document structure. It calls `normaliseTextNodes` on critical elements. If the normalization logic is flawed, it could directly lead to the test failure.\n   - **findFirstElementByTagName()**: This method is crucial for locating elements in the document. If it fails to find the correct elements, it could lead to issues in the normalization process.\n   - **normaliseTextNodes()**: This method is incomplete in the provided code. If it does not handle text nodes correctly, it could lead to structural issues in the document.\n   - **head()** and **body()**: These methods retrieve the head and body elements, respectively. They are less suspicious as they do not modify the document structure.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- **normalise()**: Ensure that the method correctly handles cases where the head or body elements are null. The current logic does not seem to handle the case where `head()` or `body()` returns null before calling `normaliseTextNodes()`.\n  \n- **normaliseTextNodes()**: Complete the implementation to ensure that text nodes are handled correctly. The current implementation does not perform any operations on the text nodes, which could lead to issues in the document structure.\n\n- **findFirstElementByTagName()**: Ensure that this method correctly traverses the document tree and returns the first matching element. The current implementation seems correct, but it should be tested with various document structures.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\n1. **normalise()** - Rank 1 (most suspicious due to direct relation to test failure)\n2. **normaliseTextNodes()** - Rank 2 (incomplete implementation could lead to structural issues)\n3. **findFirstElementByTagName()** - Rank 3 (important for locating elements)\n4. **head()** - Rank 4 (less suspicious, just retrieves head)\n5. **body()** - Rank 5 (least suspicious, just retrieves body)\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
