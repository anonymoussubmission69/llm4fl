"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **formData (method_id: 0)**:\n   - **Issue**: The method is responsible for collecting form data but seems to be adding more data than expected. Specifically, it adds values for both checked checkboxes/radio buttons and their default values, which could lead to duplicates.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Modify the logic to ensure that only one value is added for checkboxes and radio buttons. For checkboxes, only add the value if it is checked, and for radio buttons, ensure only the checked value is added.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 1.\n\n2. **isFormSubmittable (method_id: 21)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method simply returns a boolean indicating if the form can be submitted. If it returns false incorrectly, it could affect the behavior of formData, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the logic determining `formSubmit` is correctly set based on the form's state.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 2.\n\n3. **attr (method_id: 62)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method retrieves the value of an attribute. If it fails to return the correct value for an input element, it could lead to incorrect data being added in formData.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method correctly handles cases where the attribute does not exist or is empty.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 3.\n\n4. **val (method_id: 2)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method retrieves the value of an element. If it does not return the expected value, it could contribute to the issue, but it is not the primary suspect.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method correctly retrieves the value for all input types, especially for checkboxes and radio buttons.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 4.\n\n5. **isBlock (method_id: 22)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method checks if a tag is a block element. It does not directly relate to the form data collection process and is the least likely to be the cause of the test failure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes needed as it is not related to the issue.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 5.\n\nHere is the final JSON output with the re-ranked methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
