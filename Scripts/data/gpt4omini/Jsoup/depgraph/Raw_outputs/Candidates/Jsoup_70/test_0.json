"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:text()`** - This method is responsible for extracting the text from an HTML element. The test failure indicates that the expected text was not matched, suggesting that this method may not be handling whitespace or formatting correctly.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendNormalisedText(StringBuilder, TextNode)`** - This method is called within the `text()` method to append normalized text. If there is an issue with how whitespace is preserved or normalized, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.TextNode:getWholeText()`** - This method retrieves the whole text of a `TextNode`. If the text is not being retrieved correctly, it could affect the output of the `text()` method.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:preserveWhitespace(Node)`** - This method checks if whitespace should be preserved for a given node. If this logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect text extraction.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.StringUtil:appendNormalisedWhitespace(StringBuilder, String, boolean)`** - This utility method is used to append normalized whitespace. If it does not handle whitespace correctly, it could affect the final output.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is likely that the issue lies in how text is being processed and normalized, particularly with respect to whitespace handling.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 9, 30]\n}\n```"
