"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testBinaryResultThrows` is designed to check if an `IOException` is thrown when a binary file is provided as input. The expected message for the exception is \"Input is binary and unsupported\".\n2. The stack trace indicates that the assertion failed at line 526, which checks if the exception was thrown.\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include various methods related to HTTP connections and document parsing, particularly in the `HttpConnection` and `DataUtil` classes.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:parseInputStream`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input stream and may not be handling binary data correctly.\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Response:parse`** - This method parses the response and may be involved in how the input stream is processed.\n3. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:execute`** - This method executes the HTTP request and may be responsible for how the request is formed and sent.\n4. **`org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType`** - This method determines the charset from the content type, which could affect how the input is interpreted.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML and may not be handling binary data correctly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 21, 5, 12]\n}\n```"
