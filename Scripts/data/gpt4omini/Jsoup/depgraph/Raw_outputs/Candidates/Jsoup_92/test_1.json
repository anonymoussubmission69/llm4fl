"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `dropsDuplicateAttributes` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output is a string representation of an HTML element with certain attributes, while the actual output includes additional attributes that should have been dropped.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed are those involved in processing the attributes and building the HTML structure. The following methods are particularly relevant:\n\n1. **`popStackToClose(Token.EndTag endTag)`** - This method is responsible for closing tags and may be involved in how attributes are managed when closing tags are processed.\n2. **`process(Token token)`** - This method processes tokens, including start and end tags, and is crucial in determining how attributes are handled during parsing.\n3. **`insert(Token.StartTag startTag)`** - This method inserts start tags and handles attributes, which is directly related to the issue of duplicate attributes.\n4. **`insertNode(Node node)`** - This method appends nodes to the current element, which may affect how attributes are represented in the final output.\n5. **`html(Appendable accum, Document.OutputSettings out)`** - This method generates the HTML output and is responsible for how attributes are serialized.\n6. **`put(String key, String value)`** - This method manages the attributes and may be responsible for adding duplicate attributes.\n7. **`shouldCollapseAttribute(String key, String val, Document.OutputSettings out)`** - This method determines whether an attribute should be collapsed, which is directly related to the test failure.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 7, 5, 8, 188]\n}\n```"
