"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCharset` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected charset \"utf-8\" with the actual result \"UTF-8\" returned by the method `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType`. This indicates that there may be an issue with how the charset is being extracted and formatted in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is directly responsible for the output that is being tested and is likely the source of the fault.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`. While it may not directly cause the failure, if the pattern is incorrect, it could lead to issues in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. `getCharsetFromContentType` - This method is directly involved in the failure and needs to be checked for how it processes the input and formats the output.\n2. `<clinit>` - This method initializes the regex pattern used in `getCharsetFromContentType`, and if the pattern is incorrect, it could lead to the wrong charset being extracted.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
