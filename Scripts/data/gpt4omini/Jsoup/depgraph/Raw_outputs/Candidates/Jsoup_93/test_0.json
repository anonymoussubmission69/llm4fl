"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `createsFormData` is failing because it expected the size of the form data to be 6, but it was actually 7. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the `formData()` method of the `FormElement` class, which is responsible for collecting the form data.\n\nThe `formData()` method iterates over form elements and adds them to a list based on certain conditions. The conditions include checking if the element is form submittable, if it has the `disabled` attribute, and if it has a non-empty `name` attribute. The logic for handling `select`, `checkbox`, and `radio` elements is also present in this method.\n\nGiven that the failure is related to the number of items collected in the form data, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`formData()`** - This is the primary method where the data collection occurs. The logic here needs to be examined to understand why an extra item is being added.\n2. **`isFormSubmittable()`** - This method determines if an element can be submitted as part of the form. If this logic is incorrect, it could lead to unexpected elements being included in the form data.\n3. **`hasAttr(String attributeKey)`** - This method checks if an element has a specific attribute. If the logic here is flawed, it could affect the conditions under which elements are added to the form data.\n4. **`val()`** - This method retrieves the value of an element. If the value retrieval logic is incorrect, it could lead to unexpected values being added to the form data.\n5. **`isBlock()`** - This method checks if an element is a block element. If this is incorrectly implemented, it could affect the form data collection logic.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 21, 62, 2, 22]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
