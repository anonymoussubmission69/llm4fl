"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `handlesNestedImplicitTable` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` indicating that the expected HTML structure does not match the actual output. The test is specifically checking the output of the `TextUtil.stripNewlines(doc.body().html())` method against an expected string.\n\nThe stack trace points to the `ParserTest.handlesNestedImplicitTable` method, which suggests that the issue may lie within the parsing logic of the `Parser` class, particularly in how it handles nested tables.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in parsing and generating the HTML structure:\n\n1. **Parser Constructor** (`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:<init>`): Initializes the parser with the HTML input.\n2. **parse()** (`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`): Main parsing method that processes the HTML.\n3. **parseStartTag()** (`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseStartTag`): Handles the parsing of start tags, which is crucial for nested structures.\n4. **parseEndTag()** (`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseEndTag`): Handles the parsing of end tags.\n5. **addChildToParent()** (`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:addChildToParent`): Adds a child element to its parent, which is critical for maintaining the correct structure of nested elements.\n6. **popStackToClose()** (`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:popStackToClose`): Closes the appropriate tags, which is essential for ensuring that the HTML structure is valid.\n7. **stackHasValidParent()** (`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:stackHasValidParent`): Checks if the current stack has a valid parent for the child being added.\n\nThese methods are likely to be involved in the parsing logic that leads to the incorrect HTML output, which is causing the test to fail.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 4, 2, 6, 5, 15]\n}\n```"
