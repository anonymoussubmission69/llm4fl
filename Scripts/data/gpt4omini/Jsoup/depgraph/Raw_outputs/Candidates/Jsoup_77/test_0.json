"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `normalizesDiscordantTags` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected HTML output with the actual output generated by the `Jsoup` parser. The expected output is `\"<div>\\n test\\n</div>\\n<p></p>\"`, while the actual output is `\"<div>\\n test\\n <p></p>\\n</div>\"`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with how the parser handles the normalization of tags and whitespace.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **`popStackToClose(Token.EndTag endTag)`**: This method is responsible for closing tags in the stack. If it does not correctly identify the end tag, it could lead to incorrect HTML structure.\n2. **`process(Token token)`**: This method processes different types of tokens (start tags, end tags, characters). If it incorrectly processes a token, it could lead to malformed HTML.\n3. **`insert(Token.StartTag startTag)`**: This method inserts a start tag into the document. If it does not handle the insertion correctly, it could affect the final output.\n4. **`insert(Token.Character token)`**: This method handles character tokens. If whitespace handling is incorrect, it could lead to the observed discrepancy.\n5. **`insertNode(Node node)`**: This method appends a node to the current element. If nodes are not appended correctly, it could lead to structural issues in the output.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is likely that the issue lies in how these methods interact with each other during the parsing process.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]\n}\n```"
