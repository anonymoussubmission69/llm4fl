"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `handlesTextAfterData` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual HTML output. The expected output includes a `<script>` tag, while the actual output does not. This suggests that there may be an issue with how the HTML is being parsed or how the text nodes are being handled.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`parseStartTag()`** - This method is responsible for parsing the start tags in the HTML. If it fails to correctly identify or handle a `<script>` tag, it could lead to the observed issue.\n2. **`parseTextNode()`** - This method is responsible for parsing text nodes. If it incorrectly processes the text around the `<script>` tag, it could result in the missing content in the output.\n3. **`addChildToParent(Element child, boolean isEmptyElement)`** - This method adds a child element to the parent. If the child is not added correctly, it could lead to missing elements in the final output.\n4. **`parse()`** - This method orchestrates the parsing process. If there is a flaw in the overall parsing logic, it could affect how tags and text nodes are processed.\n5. **`outerHtml(StringBuilder accum)`** in `DataNode` - This method generates the outer HTML for data nodes. If it does not handle the data correctly, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 9, 10, 1]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the test failure."
