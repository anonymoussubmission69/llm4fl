"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `convertsImageToImg` is failing because it expected the output to be `<img />\\n<svg>\\n <image />\\n</svg>` but received `<img />\\n<svg>\\n<im[g] />\\n</svg>`. This indicates that there is an issue with how the `<image>` tag is being processed and converted to `<img>`.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are those that are involved in processing tokens, particularly the `<image>` tag. The following methods are relevant:\n\n1. **`process(Token t, HtmlTreeBuilder tb)`** in `HtmlTreeBuilderState$7` - This method handles the processing of start tags, including the `<image>` tag.\n2. **`insertEmpty(Token.StartTag startTag)`** in `HtmlTreeBuilder` - This method is responsible for inserting empty elements, which may include the conversion logic for the `<image>` tag.\n3. **`process(Token t, HtmlTreeBuilder tb)`** in `HtmlTreeBuilderState$6` - This method also processes start tags and may be involved in the handling of the `<image>` tag.\n4. **`process(Token t, HtmlTreeBuilder tb)`** in `HtmlTreeBuilderState$4` - This method processes tokens and may also affect how tags are handled.\n5. **`insert(Token.StartTag startTag)`** in `HtmlTreeBuilder` - This method is responsible for inserting start tags and may be involved in the conversion logic.\n\nThese methods are critical because they directly relate to how the HTML parsing and tag conversion is handled, which is where the fault likely lies.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 11, 4, 14]\n}\n``` \n\nThis JSON object lists the method IDs that are suspected to be involved in the fault based on the analysis of the test failure and the covered methods."
