"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `handlesKnownEmptyStyle` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output produced by the method under test.\n2. The expected output is a well-formed HTML string, while the actual output contains improperly formatted HTML, particularly with the `<meta>` tag.\n3. The failure occurs in the `TextUtil.stripNewlines(doc.html())` method, which suggests that the issue may be related to how the HTML is being parsed and formatted.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`handleRawtext`** - This method is responsible for handling raw text, which may include the `<meta>` tag. If it does not handle the raw text correctly, it could lead to malformed HTML.\n2. **`insertEmpty`** - This method inserts an empty element into the document. If it incorrectly processes self-closing tags, it could lead to the observed issue.\n3. **`insert`** - This method is responsible for inserting elements into the document. If it does not handle the insertion of tags correctly, it could lead to malformed HTML.\n4. **`process`** (in various states) - The `process` methods in different states of the `HtmlTreeBuilderState` class are responsible for processing tokens. If any of these methods do not handle the `<meta>` tag correctly, it could lead to the observed issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as potentially suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 13, 22, 29]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to determine if they are contributing to the failure of the test by improperly handling the HTML parsing and formatting."
