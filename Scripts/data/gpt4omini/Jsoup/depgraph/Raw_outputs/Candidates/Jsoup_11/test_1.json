"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `notClass()` is attempting to parse a document using Jsoup and is selecting elements with a CSS selector `div:not(.left)`.\n2. The failure occurs due to a `SelectorParseException`, indicating that the query could not be parsed because of an unexpected token at `:not(.left)`.\n3. The stack trace shows that the exception originates from the `findElements` method in the `Selector` class, which is called by the `select` method in the same class.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.findElements`**: This method is directly involved in parsing the selector and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.select`**: This method is responsible for invoking the `findElements` method and is part of the selection process.\n- **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.<init>`**: The constructor initializes the selector and sets up the query, which may influence how the selector is parsed.\n- **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue.consumeElementSelector`**: This method is responsible for consuming the element selector from the token queue, which is crucial for parsing the selector correctly.\n- **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate.notEmpty`**: This method is used to validate that the query is not empty, which is a prerequisite for parsing.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the parsing failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 5, 10, 2, 6]\n}\n```"
