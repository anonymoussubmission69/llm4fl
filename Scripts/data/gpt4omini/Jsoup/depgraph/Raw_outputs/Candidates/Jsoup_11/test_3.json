"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `notParas()` is attempting to select elements using a CSS selector `p:not([id=1])`. The failure occurs due to a `SelectorParseException`, indicating that the query could not be parsed correctly.\n2. The stack trace shows that the exception originates from the `findElements` method in the `Selector` class, which is called by the `select` method in the same class.\n3. The methods involved in the parsing and selection process are critical to investigate, particularly those that handle the query string and validate it.\n\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.findElements`** - This method is where the parsing error occurs.\n2. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.select`** - This method is responsible for initiating the selection process.\n3. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector.<init>`** - The constructor initializes the selector and validates the query.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue.consumeElementSelector`** - This method is responsible for consuming the element selector from the query.\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate.notEmpty`** - This method checks if the query string is not empty, which is crucial for the selector's validity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 5, 10, 6, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes methods that are directly involved in the parsing and validation of the selector query, which is where the fault is likely to propagate from."
