"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `dropsSlashFromAttributeName` is failing due to an assertion that checks if the `onerror` attribute is correctly parsed from the HTML string. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs at the assertion on line 97, which suggests that the methods involved in parsing the HTML and handling attributes are likely to be the source of the issue.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in parsing attributes and handling self-closing tags:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:byAttribute()`** - This method is responsible for parsing attributes, which is directly related to the test case.\n2. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse()`** - This method is likely involved in the overall parsing process, including attributes.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$Tag:appendAttributeName()`** - This method appends the attribute name, which is crucial for correctly parsing the attributes.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$Tag:appendAttributeValue()`** - This method appends the attribute value, which is also critical for the correct parsing of attributes.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insertEmpty()`** - This method handles the insertion of empty tags, which may relate to how self-closing tags are processed.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit()`** - This method emits tokens, which is part of the parsing process and could affect how attributes are handled.\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()`** - This method reads tokens from the input, which is essential for the parsing logic.\n8. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consume()`** - This method consumes characters from the input, which is fundamental to the parsing process.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, leading to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 25, 34, 67, 70, 151]\n}\n```"
