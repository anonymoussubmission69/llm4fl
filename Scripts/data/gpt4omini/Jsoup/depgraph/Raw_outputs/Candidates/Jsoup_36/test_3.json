"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldSelectFirstCharsetOnWeirdMultileCharsetsInMetaTags` is failing due to an `IllegalCharsetNameException` related to the charset \"ISO-8859-1,\" which is being processed in the method `getCharsetFromContentType` of the `DataUtil` class.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when the `Charset.isSupported(charset)` method is called within `getCharsetFromContentType`. The method attempts to match a charset from the provided content type string and checks if it is supported. The failure suggests that the method is not handling certain charset formats correctly, leading to the exception.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `getCharsetFromContentType(String contentType)` - This method is directly involved in the failure.\n2. `<clinit>()` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`. While it is not directly causing the failure, it is relevant as it defines how charsets are matched.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. `getCharsetFromContentType` - This method is the primary suspect as it directly leads to the exception.\n2. `<clinit>()` - This method initializes the pattern used for matching charsets, which could affect how charsets are processed.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
