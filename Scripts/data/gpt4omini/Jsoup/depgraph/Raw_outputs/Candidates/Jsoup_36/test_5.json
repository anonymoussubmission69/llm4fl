"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldNotThrowExceptionOnEmptyCharset` is failing due to an `IllegalCharsetNameException` thrown by the `Charset.checkName` method. This indicates that the method `getCharsetFromContentType` in the `DataUtil` class is attempting to validate a charset name that is either empty or invalid.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is directly involved in the failure as it is where the exception is thrown.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`. While it is not directly responsible for the failure, it sets up the context in which `getCharsetFromContentType` operates.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. `getCharsetFromContentType` - This method is the primary suspect as it directly leads to the exception.\n2. `<clinit>` - This method initializes the pattern used in `getCharsetFromContentType`, and any issues with the pattern could indirectly affect the method's behavior.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
