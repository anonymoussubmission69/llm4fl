"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `shouldReturnNullForIllegalCharsetNames` is designed to check if the method `getCharsetFromContentType` returns `null` for an illegal charset name. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalCharsetNameException` is thrown when the method attempts to check if the charset is supported.\n\n2. The method `getCharsetFromContentType` is directly involved in the failure, as it is the method being tested. The exception is thrown when it calls `Charset.isSupported(charset)`, which suggests that the logic within `getCharsetFromContentType` may not be handling illegal charset names correctly.\n\n3. The static initializer `<clinit>` of the `DataUtil` class is also relevant because it initializes the `charsetPattern`, which is used to match the charset in the content type string. If the pattern is incorrect or not matching as expected, it could lead to the method failing to handle certain inputs properly.\n\nGiven these points, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType`\n- `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>`\n\nThese methods are critical in understanding why the test is failing and how the exception is being thrown.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
