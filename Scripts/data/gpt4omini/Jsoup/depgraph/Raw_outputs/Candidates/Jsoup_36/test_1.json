"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldCorrectCharsetForDuplicateCharsetString` is failing due to an `IllegalCharsetNameException`. This exception is thrown when the charset name provided is not valid. The method `getCharsetFromContentType` in the `DataUtil` class is responsible for extracting the charset from the content type string, and it is where the exception originates.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `getCharsetFromContentType(String contentType)`: This method attempts to extract and validate the charset from the provided content type string.\n2. `<clinit>()`: This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern` used in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\nThe suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is `getCharsetFromContentType`, as it directly leads to the exception being thrown. The static initializer is less likely to be the source of the fault but is included for completeness.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n``` \n\nIn conclusion, the primary focus should be on the `getCharsetFromContentType` method (method_id: 0) to identify why it is not handling the charset extraction correctly, leading to the `IllegalCharsetNameException`."
