"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `createsFormData` is failing because it expected the size of the form data to be 6, but it was actually 7. This indicates that there may be an issue in the `formData()` method of the `FormElement` class, which is responsible for collecting the form data.\n\nThe stack trace points to the assertion failure occurring in the `createsFormData` method at line 38, which asserts the size of the data list returned by `form.formData()`. The `formData()` method iterates over the elements of the form and adds them to the data list based on certain conditions.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`formData()`** - This is the method being tested and is directly responsible for the output that is being asserted. It needs to be checked for logic errors that could lead to an incorrect count of form data.\n2. **`isFormSubmittable()`** - This method is called within `formData()` to determine if an element can be included in the form data. If this method has a bug, it could lead to elements being incorrectly excluded or included.\n3. **`addElement(Element element)`** - This method is used to add elements to the form. If there is an issue with how elements are added, it could affect the final count of form data.\n4. **`hasAttr(String attributeKey)`** - This method is used to check if an element has a specific attribute. If the logic here is flawed, it could lead to incorrect data being included in the form data.\n5. **`val()`** - This method retrieves the value of an element. If it does not return the expected value, it could lead to incorrect data being added to the form data list.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 23, 3, 72, 4]\n}\n``` \n\n- **0**: `formData()`\n- **23**: `isFormSubmittable()`\n- **3**: `addElement(Element element)`\n- **72**: `hasAttr(String attributeKey)`\n- **4**: `val()` \n\nThese methods should be reviewed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
