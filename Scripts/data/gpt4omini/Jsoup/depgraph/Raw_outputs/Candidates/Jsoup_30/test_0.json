"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:isValid(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Z` (method_id: 1)**: This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for validating HTML content against a whitelist. If the validation logic is incorrect, it could lead to the test failure.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:isValid(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;)Z` (method_id: 0)**: This method is called by the `isValid` method of `Jsoup`. It processes the document and checks if it is valid. Any issues in this method could propagate and cause the test to fail.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I` (method_id: 3)**: This method is responsible for copying safe nodes from the dirty document to the clean document. If it incorrectly identifies nodes as safe or unsafe, it could lead to an invalid document.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 14)**: This method checks if a tag is safe according to the whitelist. If the whitelist is not correctly defined or if the logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect validation results.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeAttribute(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attribute;)Z` (method_id: 5)**: This method checks if an attribute is safe for a given tag. Similar to the previous method, any issues here could affect the validation process.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:testValidProtocol(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attribute;Ljava/util/Set;)Z` (method_id: 2)**: This method tests if the protocol of an attribute is valid. If the protocol validation is incorrect, it could lead to the test failure.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:isTrue(ZLjava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 7)**: This method is used to validate boolean conditions. If any of the assertions in the test fail due to incorrect conditions, it could lead to a failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14]\n}\n```"
