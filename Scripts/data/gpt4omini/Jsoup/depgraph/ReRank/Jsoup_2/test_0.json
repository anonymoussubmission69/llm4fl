    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test case and the stack trace, the test failure is due to the incorrect handling of text nodes in the HTML parsing process. The expected output indicates that the text node handling is not functioning correctly, leading to misplaced text in the final document structure.\n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n1. **parse()**: This method orchestrates the parsing process and calls `parseStartTag()` and `parseTextNode()`. If there is an issue in this method, it could lead to incorrect parsing of the document.\n2. **parseStartTag()**: This method is responsible for handling start tags and building the document tree. If it fails to correctly identify or process a start tag, it could lead to malformed HTML structure.\n3. **parseTextNode()**: This method creates text nodes from the parsed content. If it incorrectly processes text nodes, it could lead to missing or misplaced text in the final document.\n4. **addChildToParent()**: This method manages the relationship between parent and child elements. While important, issues here are less likely to directly cause the specific test failure related to text content.\n5. **outerHtml()**: This method appends data to a StringBuilder and is less likely to be the source of the problem since it does not directly manipulate the document structure or parsing logic.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- **parse()**: Ensure that the parsing logic correctly handles the sequence of tags and text nodes. Add checks to ensure that text nodes are correctly appended after their respective tags.\n  \n- **parseStartTag()**: Validate that the tag name is correctly consumed and that attributes are parsed accurately. Ensure that the logic for handling empty elements is robust.\n\n- **parseTextNode()**: Ensure that the text consumed is correctly processed and that it does not inadvertently consume tags. This method should also handle cases where text nodes are adjacent to tags properly.\n\n- **addChildToParent()**: Ensure that the parent-child relationship is correctly established and that the stack is managed properly to avoid incorrect nesting.\n\n- **outerHtml()**: This method seems to be functioning correctly, but ensure that it is called at the right time in the parsing process.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods:\nGiven the analysis, the re-ranking of methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,  // parseTextNode is now the most suspicious due to its direct role in handling text nodes.\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,  // parse is still very suspicious as it orchestrates the parsing process.\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,  // parseStartTag is crucial for building the document tree.\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10, // addChildToParent is important but less likely to cause the specific test failure.\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,  // outerHtml is the least suspicious as it does not manipulate the document structure.\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
