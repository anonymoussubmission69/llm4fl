    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `handlesCustomProtocols` is failing because the expected output includes certain protocols (`cid` and `data`) in the cleaned HTML, but they are not being preserved in the actual output. This indicates that the methods responsible for handling protocols and attributes are likely the source of the issue.\n\n2. The methods that are most likely to be causing the failure are those that deal with protocol validation and attribute copying. \n\n### Method Analysis and Potential Fixes\n\n1. **Method ID 3 (`testValidProtocol`)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method checks if the attribute's value starts with a valid protocol and returns false if it does. This could lead to the protocol being discarded.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method correctly identifies valid protocols and does not prematurely return false. It should allow valid protocols to be preserved.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 1.\n\n2. **Method ID 1 (`copySafeNodes`)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method is responsible for copying nodes and attributes. If it incorrectly identifies nodes as unsafe, it could lead to the loss of important attributes.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Review the logic that determines whether a node is safe. Ensure that it correctly identifies nodes that should be preserved, especially those with important protocols.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 2.\n\n3. **Method ID 2 (`createSafeElement`)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method creates a safe element and discards unsafe attributes. If it discards attributes that should be preserved, it could lead to test failure.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method checks against the whitelist correctly and does not discard attributes that are valid protocols.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 3.\n\n4. **Method ID 4 (`clean`)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method orchestrates the cleaning process but mainly delegates work to other methods. It is less likely to be the direct cause of the issue.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No immediate fix needed, but ensure that it correctly calls the methods responsible for protocol handling.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 4.\n\n5. **Method ID 0 (`addProtocols`)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method adds protocols to a whitelist. While it is important, it does not directly affect the cleaning process.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the protocols are correctly added and that the whitelist is being used properly in the cleaning process.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 5.\n\n6. **Method ID 29 (`clean`)**:\n   - **Issue**: This method initiates the cleaning process and is less likely to be the source of the issue.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No immediate fix needed, but ensure that it correctly utilizes the whitelist and cleaning logic.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 6.\n\n### Final Ranking and Output\n\nBased on the analysis, the ranking remains the same as the original ranking since the methods identified are indeed the most suspicious based on their roles in handling protocols and attributes.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 29,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
