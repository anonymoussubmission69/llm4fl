"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testQuotedCharset` is designed to validate the behavior of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class. The test checks various content type strings and expects specific charset outputs.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **`DataUtil.<clinit>()`**: This is a static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`. While it doesn't directly relate to the logic of `getCharsetFromContentType`, any issues in the pattern could affect the method's behavior.\n\n2. **`DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType(String)`**: This method is the primary focus of the test. It uses a regex pattern to extract the charset from the content type string and checks if the charset is supported. This method is likely where the fault lies, especially if the regex pattern does not match the expected input correctly or if the charset extraction logic has issues.\n\nGiven the context, the suspicious methods that need further analysis are:\n\n- `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType(String)` (method_id: 1)\n- `DataUtil.<clinit>()` (method_id: 0) - while less likely, it could still be relevant if the pattern is incorrect.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
