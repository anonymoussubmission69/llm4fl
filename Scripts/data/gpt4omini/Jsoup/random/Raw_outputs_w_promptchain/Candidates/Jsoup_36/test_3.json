"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldSelectFirstCharsetOnWeirdMultileCharsetsInMetaTags` is asserting that the method `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType` returns the expected charset \"ISO-8859-1\" when provided with a specific content type string. \n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **DataUtil.<clinit>()**: This is a static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes a pattern used for matching charsets in content types.\n2. **DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType(String)**: This method is responsible for extracting the charset from the provided content type string.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- **DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType**: This method directly relates to the failure since it is the one being tested. The logic within this method, particularly how it handles the regex matching and charset validation, could be the source of the fault.\n- **DataUtil.<clinit>()**: While this is a static initializer, if the pattern is incorrectly defined or initialized, it could lead to issues in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\nThus, the potential suspicious methods are ranked as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0]\n}\n``` \n\nThis ranking indicates that the `getCharsetFromContentType` method is the primary focus for fault analysis, while the static initializer should also be reviewed for any potential issues with the regex pattern."
