"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldNotThrowExceptionOnEmptyCharset` is designed to check the behavior of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class when provided with specific input strings that represent content types with empty charset values.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the test is failing when it calls `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType` with the inputs `\"text/html; charset=\"` and `\"text/html; charset=;\"`. The expected output is `null`, but the actual output is likely not `null`, leading to the failure of the assertions.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This is the method being tested, which processes the content type string to extract the charset.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`getCharsetFromContentType`**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for returning the charset. Any issues in its logic could lead to the test failure.\n2. **`<clinit>`**: The static initializer sets up the `charsetPattern`. If the pattern is incorrectly defined, it could lead to unexpected behavior in `getCharsetFromContentType`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious, but the primary focus should be on `getCharsetFromContentType` since it directly handles the input and output related to the test case.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
