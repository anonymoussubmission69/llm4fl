"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldCorrectCharsetForDuplicateCharsetString` is asserting that the method `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType` correctly extracts the charset from a content type string. The test fails when the expected charset does not match the actual result returned by the method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `DataUtil.<clinit>()` - This is a static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType(String contentType)` - This method is responsible for extracting the charset from the provided content type string.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- The `getCharsetFromContentType` method, as it directly relates to the test case and is responsible for the logic that is being tested.\n- The static initializer `<clinit>()` may also be relevant since it initializes the `charsetPattern`, which is used in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
