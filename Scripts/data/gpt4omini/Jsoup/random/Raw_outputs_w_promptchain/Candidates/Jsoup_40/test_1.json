"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesInvalidDoctypes()` is designed to check the behavior of the `Jsoup.parse()` method when provided with various invalid doctype strings. The test expects specific HTML outputs for these inputs.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure may be related to the validation of the doctype strings, which suggests that methods responsible for parsing and validating the input are likely involved in the fault.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their roles in validation and parsing:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notNull(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This method checks if an object is null. If the input to the parser is null, it could lead to a failure.\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notEmpty(Ljava/lang/String;)V`** - This method checks if a string is empty or null. It is likely called when validating the doctype string.\n3. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is the entry point for parsing HTML and is directly invoked in the test.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for the actual parsing logic.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)V`** - This method initializes the parsing process and validates the input.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`** - This method processes tokens during parsing, including doctype tokens.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 12]\n}\n```"
