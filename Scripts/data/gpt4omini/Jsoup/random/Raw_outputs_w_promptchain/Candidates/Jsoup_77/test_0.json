"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `normalizesDiscordantTags` is failing due to an issue with the HTML parsing and normalization process. The expected output is not matching the actual output, indicating that there may be a problem in the methods responsible for parsing and normalizing the HTML content.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the parsing and normalization process:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is responsible for initiating the parsing of the HTML string.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput`** - This method handles the actual input parsing logic.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input and constructing the document tree.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:insert`** - This method inserts nodes into the document tree, which is crucial for the structure of the parsed document.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:popStackToClose`** - This method manages the closing of tags in the document tree, which could affect the final output if not handled correctly.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tag:valueOf`** - This method normalizes the tag names, which is directly related to the test's focus on normalization.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 8, 164, 166, 80]\n}\n```"
