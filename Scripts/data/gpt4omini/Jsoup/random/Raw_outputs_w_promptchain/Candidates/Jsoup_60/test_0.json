"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `testParsesSingleQuoteInContains` is expected to throw a `Selector.SelectorParseException` when parsing a query string that contains a single quote. The test is likely checking for proper handling of special characters in the query.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `QueryParser` and `TokenQueue` classes, which are responsible for parsing the query string. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`QueryParser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;`** - This method initiates the parsing process and is the entry point for the query string.\n2. **`QueryParser:contains(Z)V`** - This method handles the `:contains` selector, which is directly related to the test case.\n3. **`TokenQueue:consumeElementSelector()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method consumes the element selector from the query, which may be affected by the presence of special characters.\n4. **`TokenQueue:chompBalanced(CC)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is responsible for handling balanced characters, which could be relevant when dealing with quotes in the query.\n5. **`TokenQueue:matches(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This method checks if the current position in the queue matches a given string, which is crucial for parsing logic.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure of the test. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [7, 11, 25, 22, 15]\n}\n```"
