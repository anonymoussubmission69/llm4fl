"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `exceptionOnUncloseAttribute` is expected to throw a `Selector.SelectorParseException` when parsing a query string that has an unclosed attribute. The relevant method being tested is `QueryParser.parse(String query)` which is called with the input `section > a[href=\\\\\"]`.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure likely occurs during the parsing process, specifically when handling the attribute in the query string. The methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **`QueryParser.parse(String query)`** - This method is responsible for initiating the parsing process.\n2. **`QueryParser.parse()`** - This method is called internally by `parse(String query)` and handles the actual parsing logic.\n3. **`TokenQueue.consumeElementSelector()`** - This method is responsible for consuming the element selector from the query string, which may be where the unclosed attribute is being processed.\n4. **`TokenQueue.chompBalanced(char open, char close)`** - This method is used to handle balanced characters, which could be relevant for parsing attributes.\n5. **`Validate.notEmpty(String string)`** - This method checks if the string is empty and throws an exception if it is, which could be relevant if the attribute is not properly closed.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and the fault could propagate through them during the parsing process.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 7, 20, 18, 1]\n}\n```"
