"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testQuotedCharset` is designed to validate the behavior of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class. The test checks various input strings to ensure that the method correctly extracts and returns the charset.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is responsible for extracting the charset from the provided content type string.\n\nGiven that the test is failing, the most suspicious methods to analyze further are:\n- `getCharsetFromContentType`: This method directly processes the input and returns the charset. If the logic for matching the charset is incorrect, it could lead to the test failures observed.\n- The static initializer `<clinit>` is also relevant because it initializes the `charsetPattern`, which is used in `getCharsetFromContentType`. If the pattern is incorrect, it could lead to failures in the matching logic.\n\nThus, the potential suspicious methods are:\n- Method ID 1: `getCharsetFromContentType`\n- Method ID 0: `<clinit>`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
