"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test method `testCharset` is designed to validate the behavior of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class. The test checks various content type strings and their expected charset outputs.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `DataUtil.<clinit>()` - This is a static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType(String)` - This method is responsible for extracting the charset from the provided content type string.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The `getCharsetFromContentType` method is directly invoked in the test and is likely the source of the failure if the assertions do not hold true.\n- The static initializer `<clinit>()` sets up the `charsetPattern`, which is used in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method. If there is an issue with the pattern (e.g., incorrect regex), it could lead to failures in the method that uses it.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the fault. The `getCharsetFromContentType` method is particularly critical since it is directly tested.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
