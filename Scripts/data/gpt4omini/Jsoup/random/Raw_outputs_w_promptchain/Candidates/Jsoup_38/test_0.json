"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `convertsImageToImg` is failing when trying to convert an HTML string containing an `<image>` tag into an `<img>` tag. The test expects the output to be a specific HTML structure, but it seems that the parsing logic is not handling the `<image>` tag correctly.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** (method_id: 0) - This is the entry point for parsing the HTML string. If there is an issue with how the HTML is parsed, it will affect the output.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** (method_id: 1) - This method is responsible for initiating the parsing process. Any issues here could lead to incorrect parsing behavior.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** (method_id: 4) - This method runs the parser and processes tokens. If the tokenization is incorrect, it could lead to the wrong output.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process`** (method_id: 9) - This method processes tokens and is crucial for determining how tags are handled during parsing.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insert`** (method_id: 12) - This method is responsible for inserting new elements into the document. If it does not handle the `<image>` tag correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insertEmpty`** (method_id: 15) - This method handles self-closing tags. If it does not recognize the `<image>` tag as a self-closing tag, it could lead to incorrect behavior.\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read`** (method_id: 104) - This method reads tokens from the input. If it does not correctly identify the `<image>` tag, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 9, 12, 15, 104]\n}\n```"
