"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testNormalisesStructure` is designed to check the normalization of an HTML document parsed by Jsoup. The test fails when comparing the expected output with the actual output of the `TextUtil.stripNewlines(doc.html())` method.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious for further analysis:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If there is an issue with how the HTML is parsed, it could lead to incorrect normalization.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called to normalize the document. If there are issues in how normalization is implemented, it could directly affect the output.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normaliseTextNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V`** - This method is responsible for normalizing text nodes within the document. Any issues here could lead to incorrect text representation.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:findFirstElementByTagName(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method is used to find specific elements in the document. If it fails to find or incorrectly processes elements, it could affect normalization.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:html()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method retrieves the HTML content of an element. If the HTML is not retrieved correctly, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendChild(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method adds child nodes to an element. If child nodes are not appended correctly, it could affect the structure of the document.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;)V`** - This method generates the outer HTML representation of an element. If there are issues in how the outer HTML is constructed, it could lead to incorrect output.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notNull(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This method is used to validate that an object is not null. If any required objects are null, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 97, 98, 99, 92, 88, 79, 43]\n}\n```"
