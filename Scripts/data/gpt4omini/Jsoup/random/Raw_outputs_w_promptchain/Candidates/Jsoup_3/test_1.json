"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesNestedImplicitTable` is failing when trying to parse an HTML string containing nested tables. The test expects a specific output HTML structure, which suggests that the parsing logic is not handling nested tables correctly.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This is the entry point for parsing the HTML string. If there is an issue with how the HTML is parsed, it could lead to incorrect document structure.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Z)V`** - The constructor initializes the parser with the HTML string. Any issues here could affect how the parser interprets the input.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method creates a new parser instance and calls the parsing logic. If the parameters are not handled correctly, it could lead to parsing errors.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse()`** - This method contains the core parsing logic. If there are issues in how tags are processed, it could lead to malformed HTML.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseStartTag()`** - This method is responsible for handling the start tags. If it fails to recognize or handle nested tags correctly, it could lead to incorrect document structure.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseEndTag()`** - Similar to `parseStartTag`, this method handles end tags. Issues here could also lead to incorrect nesting of elements.\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:addChildToParent(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Z)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method adds child elements to their parent. If the logic for determining valid parents is flawed, it could lead to incorrect tree structure.\n8. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:popStackToClose(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Tag;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method is responsible for closing tags correctly. If it fails to close tags properly, it could lead to malformed HTML.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
