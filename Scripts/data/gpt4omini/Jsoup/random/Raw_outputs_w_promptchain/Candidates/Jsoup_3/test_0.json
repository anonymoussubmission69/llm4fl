"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testAppendRowToTable` is attempting to append a new row to an HTML table and then assert that the resulting HTML matches the expected output. The failure likely stems from the methods involved in parsing and manipulating the HTML structure.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in parsing and appending elements:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object.\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:append(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method appends a string of HTML to the current element, which is crucial for adding the new row.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is used internally when appending HTML to parse the body fragment.\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendChild(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method adds a child node to the current element, which is part of the appending process.\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:html()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method retrieves the HTML content of the element, which is involved in the final assertion.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they handle the parsing and manipulation of the HTML structure, which is critical to the test's success.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 71, 4, 69, 75]\n}\n```"
