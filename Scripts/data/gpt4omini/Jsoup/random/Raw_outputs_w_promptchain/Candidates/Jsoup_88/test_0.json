"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `booleanAttributesAreEmptyStringValues` is designed to check if the `hidden` attribute of a `div` element is treated as an empty string when parsed. The test fails at the assertion `assertEquals(\"\", attributes.get(\"hidden\"));`, indicating that the expected value is not returned.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods related to parsing HTML and handling attributes. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:get(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 67)** - This method retrieves the value of an attribute by its key. Since the test is checking the value of the `hidden` attribute, this method is critical to investigate.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:indexOfKey(Ljava/lang/String;)I` (method_id: 65)** - This method finds the index of a key in the attributes. If the key is not found or if there is an issue with how keys are stored, it could lead to the wrong value being returned.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;` (method_id: 69)** - This method adds or updates an attribute. If there is an issue with how attributes are added, it could affect retrieval.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 10)** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If the parsing logic does not handle boolean attributes correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insert(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token$StartTag;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;` (method_id: 29)** - This method inserts a start tag into the tree. If the insertion logic does not correctly handle boolean attributes, it could lead to incorrect attribute values.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$StartTag:finaliseTag()V` (method_id: 52)** - This method finalizes a start tag, which may include setting attributes. If there is an issue in this method, it could affect how attributes are represented.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$StartTag:newAttribute()V` (method_id: 51)** - This method creates a new attribute for a start tag. If the logic for creating attributes is flawed, it could lead to incorrect attribute values.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods that need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [67, 65, 69, 10, 29, 52, 51]\n}\n```"
