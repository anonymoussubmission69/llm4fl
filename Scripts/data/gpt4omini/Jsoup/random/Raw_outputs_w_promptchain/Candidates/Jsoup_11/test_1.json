"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `notClass()` is attempting to parse an HTML string and select elements based on a CSS selector. The test fails when it asserts the size of the selected elements and their ID. The suspicious methods that could potentially lead to the fault are primarily related to the parsing and selection of elements.\n\nHere are the methods that need to be analyzed:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called during the parsing process and is crucial for understanding how the HTML is interpreted.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseStartTag()V`** - This method handles the parsing of start tags, which is essential for correctly building the document structure.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseEndTag()V`** - This method handles the parsing of end tags, which is also critical for the document structure.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseTextNode()V`** - This method deals with text nodes, which could affect how text is represented in the parsed document.\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is used to select elements based on a CSS query, which is directly related to the test's assertion.\n7. **`org.jsoup.select.Collector:collect(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Evaluator;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method collects elements based on the evaluation criteria, which is important for understanding how the selection is performed.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 4, 5, 80, 99, 111]\n}\n```"
