"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `attributeWithBrackets` is failing when trying to select elements from an HTML string using Jsoup. The test is specifically checking for elements with attributes that contain special characters like brackets and closing brackets.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include:\n\n1. `org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(String html)`\n2. `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(String html, String baseUri)`\n3. `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(String input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors)`\n4. `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse(String input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors)`\n5. `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()`\n6. `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process(Token token)`\n7. `org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Token token)`\n8. `org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(String cssQuery)`\n\nThe methods that are most suspicious and need further analysis are:\n\n- **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(String html)`**: This method is the entry point for parsing the HTML string. If there is an issue with how the HTML is being parsed, it could lead to the failure of the test.\n  \n- **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(String html, String baseUri)`**: This method is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues in handling special characters in attributes could originate here.\n\n- **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()`**: This method is responsible for running the parsing logic. If there are issues in how tokens are processed, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n- **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process(Token token)`**: This method processes tokens during parsing. If it does not handle tokens with special characters correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n\n- **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(String cssQuery)`**: This method is used to select elements based on CSS queries. If the selection logic does not handle special characters properly, it could lead to the test failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 11, 90]\n}\n```"
