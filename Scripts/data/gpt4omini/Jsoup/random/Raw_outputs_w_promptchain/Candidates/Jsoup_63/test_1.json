"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `tracksErrorsWhenRequested` is designed to parse an HTML string and track parsing errors. The test expects a specific number of errors and their messages. The stack trace indicates that the test is failing due to unexpected parsing behavior, which suggests that the methods responsible for parsing and error tracking in the `Parser` and `TreeBuilder` classes are likely involved.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Parser Class Methods**:\n   - `Parser.parseInput(String html, String baseUri)`: This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML and could be where the parsing logic is failing.\n   - `Parser.getErrors()`: This method retrieves the list of errors encountered during parsing, which is directly related to the test's assertions.\n   - `Parser.setTrackErrors(int maxErrors)`: This method sets the maximum number of errors to track, which could affect the behavior of error tracking.\n\n2. **TreeBuilder Class Methods**:\n   - `TreeBuilder.parse(Reader input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors, ParseSettings settings)`: This method is responsible for the actual parsing logic and could be where the parsing errors are generated.\n   - `TreeBuilder.initialiseParse(Reader input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors, ParseSettings settings)`: This method initializes the parsing process and could be a point of failure if the setup is incorrect.\n   - `TreeBuilder.processStartTag(String name)`: This method processes start tags and could be where the parsing logic fails if the tags are not handled correctly.\n   - `TreeBuilder.processEndTag(String name)`: Similar to the start tag processing, this method handles end tags and could also be a source of errors.\n\n3. **Tokeniser Class Methods**:\n   - `Tokeniser.read()`: This method reads tokens from the input and is crucial for the parsing process. If it fails to read tokens correctly, it could lead to parsing errors.\n   - `Tokeniser.emit(Token token)`: This method emits tokens and could be involved in generating errors if the tokens are not emitted correctly.\n\n4. **Error Handling Methods**:\n   - `Tokeniser.error(String errorMsg)`: This method adds an error message to the list of errors, which is directly related to the test's assertions about the expected errors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 3, 8, 7, 123, 130, 171]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the test failure."
