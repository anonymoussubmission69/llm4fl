"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `preservedCaseLinksCantNest` is failing due to an issue with the HTML parsing and whitespace normalization. The test is asserting that the normalized HTML output matches the expected string, but it seems that the actual output does not match.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed are primarily from the `StringUtil` class, which is responsible for string manipulation and whitespace normalization. The methods that are particularly relevant include:\n\n1. **`normaliseWhitespace(String string)`** - This method is responsible for normalizing whitespace in the input string. Any issues here could directly affect the output of the test.\n2. **`appendNormalisedWhitespace(StringBuilder accum, String string, boolean stripLeading)`** - This method appends normalized whitespace to a `StringBuilder`. If there are issues in how whitespace is appended, it could lead to incorrect output.\n3. **`isActuallyWhitespace(int c)`** - This method checks if a character is considered whitespace. If this method incorrectly identifies characters, it could lead to improper normalization.\n4. **`isWhitespace(int c)`** - Similar to the above, this method checks for whitespace characters. Any inaccuracies here could propagate errors in whitespace handling.\n5. **`isBlank(String string)`** - This method checks if a string is blank. If it misidentifies strings, it could affect the normalization process.\n\nAdditionally, methods from the `Parser` and `TreeBuilder` classes may also be relevant, as they are involved in parsing the HTML input. However, the primary focus should be on the `StringUtil` methods mentioned above.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 7, 4, 3, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes the method IDs of the suspicious methods that should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
