"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesControlCharactersAfterTagName` is failing when trying to clean an HTML string containing control characters. The test expects a specific output after cleaning the input HTML string.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is responsible for cleaning the HTML input. Since the test is failing during the cleaning process, this method is a primary suspect.\n   \n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called within the `clean` method to parse the body of the HTML. If there are issues with how control characters are handled during parsing, it could lead to the failure.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the body fragment of the HTML. Similar to the previous method, any issues here could propagate and cause the test to fail.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/List;`** - This method is involved in parsing fragments of HTML and could also be a source of issues if it does not handle control characters correctly.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method is responsible for running the parser and could be involved in how the HTML is processed, especially with control characters.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read(Lorg/jsoup/parser/CharacterReader;)V`** - This method is responsible for reading tokens from the input. If it does not handle control characters properly, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is likely that the issue lies in how control characters are processed during the cleaning and parsing of the HTML input.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 4, 3, 6, 87]\n}\n```"
