"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIsValidDocument` is checking the validity of HTML documents using the `Cleaner` class, specifically the `isValid` method.\n2. The test fails when trying to validate a document that contains a `<script>` tag, which suggests that the issue may be related to how the `Cleaner` processes script tags or how it interacts with the `Whitelist`.\n3. The `Cleaner` class is responsible for determining if a document is valid based on the provided `Whitelist`. The methods involved in this process include `isValid`, `copySafeNodes`, and `createSafeElement`.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:isValid(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;)Z`** (method_id: 183): This method is the entry point for validating a document.\n- **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I`** (method_id: 184): This method is responsible for copying safe nodes from the source to the destination.\n- **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:createSafeElement(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Cleaner$ElementMeta;`** (method_id: 185): This method creates a safe element based on the source element and checks against the whitelist.\n- **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** (method_id: 171): This method checks if a tag is safe according to the whitelist.\n- **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addTags([Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`** (method_id: 168): This method adds tags to the whitelist, which may affect the validation process.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and play a crucial role in the validation process, making them essential for further investigation.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [183, 184, 185, 171, 168]\n}\n```"
