The failure likely stems from the methods involved in parsing and manipulating the HTML structure.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:prepend(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;` (method_id: 120)** - This method is directly called in the test to prepend a new row to the table. If there is an issue with how it processes the input HTML, it could lead to the test failure.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 4)** - This method is used within the `prepend` method to parse the HTML string. If there are issues in parsing the HTML correctly, it could affect the structure of the document.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 3)** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. Any issues here could propagate through the methods that rely on the parsed document.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:html()Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 74)** - This method is called to retrieve the HTML content of the element. If the HTML structure is not as expected, it could lead to assertion failures.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;)V` (method_id: 73)** - This method is responsible for generating the outer HTML representation of the element. If there are issues in how the HTML is constructed, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected output.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 81)** - This method is called to normalize the document structure. If the normalization process is flawed, it could affect the final output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [120, 4, 3, 74, 73, 81]\n}\n```"
