    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 2)** - This method is responsible for cleaning the HTML input based on the provided whitelist. Since the test is checking the output of the cleaning process, any issues in this method could directly affect the test outcome.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 3)** - This overloaded version of the clean method also plays a role in the cleaning process and could propagate issues if the base URI handling is incorrect.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 0)** - This method is used to parse the HTML string into a Document object. If the parsing fails or does not handle framesets correctly, it could lead to unexpected results in the cleaning process.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 4)** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues here could lead to incorrect Document structures.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z` (method_id: 14)** - This method processes tokens during parsing. If it does not handle specific tokens correctly, it could lead to malformed Document structures.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insert(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V` (method_id: 22)** - This method is responsible for inserting elements into the tree structure. If it fails to insert elements correctly, it could lead to an incomplete or incorrect Document.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I` (method_id: 190)** - This method is responsible for copying safe nodes from the source to the destination. If it incorrectly identifies safe tags, it could lead to an empty or incorrect output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 3, 0, 4, 14, 22, 190]\n}\n```"
