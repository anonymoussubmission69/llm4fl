If there are issues with the parsing logic, it could lead to incorrect document structure, affecting sibling retrieval.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - Similar to the above, this method handles the parsing of the HTML string and could introduce errors in the document structure.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the parser and processes tokens. If there are issues in token processing, it could lead to incorrect document representation.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:nextElementSibling()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method retrieves the next sibling element. If the document structure is incorrect due to parsing issues, this method may not return the expected results.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:previousElementSibling()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - Similar to the next sibling method, if the document structure is incorrect, this method may also fail to return the correct previous sibling.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:getElementById(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method retrieves an element by its ID. If the parsing did not correctly create the elements, this method may not find the expected element.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:text()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method retrieves the text content of the element. If the element structure is incorrect, the text retrieved may not be accurate.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:children()Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method retrieves the child elements of the current element. If the parent-child relationships are incorrect due to parsing issues, this method may not return the expected children.\n\nThe methods listed above are interconnected, as issues in parsing can propagate through the document structure, affecting sibling and child retrieval methods.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 161, 162, 163, 164, 87]\n}\n```"
