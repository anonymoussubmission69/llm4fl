If there is an issue with how the input is parsed, it could lead to incorrect document structure.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput`** - This method handles the actual parsing logic. Any issues here could directly affect the output of the parsing process.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method is involved in the parsing process and could be a source of errors if the tree structure is not built correctly.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:insert`** - This method is responsible for inserting nodes into the document tree. If it fails to insert nodes correctly, it could lead to malformed documents.\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.StringUtil:normaliseWhitespace`** - This method is used to normalize whitespace in the output. If it does not handle whitespace correctly, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected output.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they all play a role in the parsing and construction of the document from the input string. Any failure in one of these methods could propagate and cause the test to fail.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 6, 150, 120]\n}\n```"
