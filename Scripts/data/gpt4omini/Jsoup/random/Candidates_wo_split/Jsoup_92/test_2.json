    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML input. Given that the test is checking for duplicate attributes, this method is likely where the parsing logic is implemented.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:getErrors()Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;`** - This method retrieves the list of errors encountered during parsing. It is crucial to check how errors are tracked and reported, especially for duplicate attributes.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method generates the outer HTML of an element. Since the test is asserting the expected output HTML, any issues in this method could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;`** - This method is responsible for adding attributes to an element. If there is a logic error in how attributes are added or checked for duplicates, it could directly affect the test outcome.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:normalize()V`** - This method normalizes the attributes, which may include converting them to a consistent case. If this normalization is not handled correctly, it could lead to duplicate attributes being treated as distinct.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.ParseErrorList:noTracking()Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;`** - This method creates a list of errors without tracking. It is important to understand how errors are managed, especially in the context of duplicate attributes.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.ParseErrorList:tracking(I)Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;`** - Similar to the above, this method tracks errors. The way errors are tracked could influence how duplicate attributes are reported.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If the tokenization process does not correctly identify attributes, it could lead to issues with duplicates.\n\n9. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)V`** - This method emits tokens. If tokens are emitted incorrectly, it could affect the parsing logic and lead to duplicate attributes.\n\n10. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState$4:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;Lorg/jsoup/parser/HtmlTreeBuilder;)Z`** - This method processes tokens in a specific state. The logic here could be critical in determining how attributes are handled during parsing.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [15, 16, 102, 81, 87, 89, 252, 253, 170, 176, 194, 201]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure related to duplicate attributes."
