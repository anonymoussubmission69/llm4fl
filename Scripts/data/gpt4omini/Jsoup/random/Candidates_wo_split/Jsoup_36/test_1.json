The test fails when the expected charset \"iso-8859-1\" is not returned.\n\nFrom the covered methods, we have identified two methods that are relevant to the test:\n\n1. **DataUtil.<clinit>()** - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`. If there is an issue with the pattern, it could lead to incorrect matching in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\n2. **DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType(String contentType)** - This method is directly responsible for extracting the charset from the content type string. If there is a bug in the logic of this method, it could lead to the failure of the test.\n\nBoth methods are suspicious as they are directly related to the functionality being tested. The static initializer sets up the pattern used for matching, and the `getCharsetFromContentType` method implements the logic for extracting the charset.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
