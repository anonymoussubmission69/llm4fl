If it fails, it indicates that the HTML validation logic might be flawed.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 0)**: This method is called within the `isValid` method. If `isValid` fails, it could be due to issues in how the body fragment is parsed.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 3)**: This method is responsible for parsing the body fragment. Any issues here could lead to invalid HTML being accepted or valid HTML being rejected.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/List;` (method_id: 2)**: This method is called by `parseBodyFragment` and is responsible for parsing HTML fragments. If there are issues in fragment parsing, it could affect the overall validation.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:isValid(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;)Z` (method_id: 254)**: This method checks if a document is valid according to the whitelist. If the document is not valid, it could indicate that the cleaning process is not functioning as expected.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I` (method_id: 255)**: This method is responsible for copying safe nodes from the source to the destination. If it fails to copy nodes correctly, it could lead to invalid HTML.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 237)**: This method checks if a tag is safe according to the whitelist. If it incorrectly identifies a tag as unsafe, it could lead to valid HTML being rejected.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeAttribute(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attribute;)Z` (method_id: 238)**: This method checks if an attribute is safe. If it fails, it could lead to valid attributes being rejected.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 3, 2, 254, 255, 237, 238]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the test failures observed."
