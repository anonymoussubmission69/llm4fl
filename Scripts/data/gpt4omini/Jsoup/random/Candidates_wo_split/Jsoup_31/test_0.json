The test fails when it attempts to assert the normalized whitespace of the parsed document's outer HTML.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed are primarily those involved in parsing the input string and generating the output. The following methods are particularly relevant:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is responsible for initiating the parsing process.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput`** - This method handles the actual parsing of the input string.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input and building the document structure.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:insert`** - This method is involved in inserting nodes into the document structure, which is crucial for correctly building the output.\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.StringUtil:normaliseWhitespace`** - This method is responsible for normalizing whitespace in the output, which is directly related to the failure in the test.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they work together to parse the input and generate the output. Any issues in parsing or node insertion could lead to incorrect output, which would cause the test to fail.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 6, 150, 120]\n}\n```"
