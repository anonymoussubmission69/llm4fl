The test expects the exception message to be \"Input is binary and unsupported\". \n\nThe following methods are particularly relevant to this test:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:data(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/Connection;`** - This method is responsible for adding data to the connection request. It is crucial to check how it handles binary data.\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:execute()Lorg/jsoup/Connection$Response;`** - This method executes the connection and is likely where the exception is thrown if the data is not handled correctly.\n3. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Response:parse()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method parses the response and may also be involved in handling the data type.\n4. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Response:setupFromConnection(Ljava/net/HttpURLConnection;Lorg/jsoup/helper/HttpConnection$Response;)V`** - This method sets up the response from the connection and may be relevant if the response handling is incorrect.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure of the test. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [237, 238, 271, 274]\n}\n```"
