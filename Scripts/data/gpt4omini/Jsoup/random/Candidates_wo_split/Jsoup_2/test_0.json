    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesTextAfterData` is failing when it attempts to assert the output of `TextUtil.stripNewlines(doc.html())` against an expected HTML string. The failure likely stems from the parsing of the HTML string provided to `Jsoup.parse(h)`.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious for further analysis:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If there is an issue with how the HTML is parsed, it could lead to incorrect output.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues in this method could directly affect the resulting Document.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseTextNode()V`** - This method handles the parsing of text nodes within the HTML. If it does not correctly handle the text nodes, it could lead to incorrect HTML structure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called to normalize the Document after parsing. If the normalization process is flawed, it could result in unexpected output.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:html()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method retrieves the HTML representation of an Element. If the Element's structure is incorrect due to parsing issues, the output will not match the expected result.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;)V`** - This method is responsible for generating the outer HTML of an Element. Any issues here could also lead to discrepancies in the final output.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 4, 78, 72, 71]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
