    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 2)**: This method is responsible for cleaning the HTML input based on the provided whitelist. Since the test is checking the output of the cleaning process, any issues in this method could directly affect the test outcome.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 3)**: This overloaded version of the clean method also plays a role in the cleaning process and could propagate issues if the base URI handling is incorrect.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 0)**: This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If the parsing fails or does not handle framesets correctly, it could lead to unexpected results in the cleaning process.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 4)**: This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues here could propagate up to the `clean` methods.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z` (method_id: 14)**: This method processes tokens during parsing. If it does not handle specific tokens correctly, it could lead to incorrect document structure, affecting the cleaning process.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I` (method_id: 190)**: This method is responsible for copying safe nodes from the source to the destination element. If it incorrectly identifies safe tags, it could lead to an incorrect output.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insert(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V` (method_id: 22)**: This method inserts elements into the tree structure. If it does not maintain the correct structure, it could lead to issues during the cleaning process.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:resetInsertionMode()V` (method_id: 28)**: This method resets the insertion mode, which is crucial for maintaining the correct parsing state. If it does not reset correctly, it could lead to incorrect parsing behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 3, 0, 4, 14, 190, 22, 28]\n}\n```"
