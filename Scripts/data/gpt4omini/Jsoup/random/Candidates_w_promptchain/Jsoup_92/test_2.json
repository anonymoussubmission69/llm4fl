    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML input. Since the test is checking for duplicate attributes, any issues in parsing could lead to incorrect handling of attributes.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:getErrors()Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;`** - This method retrieves the list of parsing errors. The test checks for the presence of a specific error message (\"Duplicate attribute\"), making this method crucial for understanding how errors are tracked.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method generates the outer HTML of an element. The test asserts the expected output of the parsed HTML, so any issues in generating the correct HTML structure could lead to the failure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;`** - This method is responsible for adding attributes to an element. If there are issues with how attributes are added or normalized, it could lead to duplicates.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:normalize()V`** - This method normalizes the attributes, which is essential for ensuring that attributes are treated consistently (e.g., case sensitivity). If normalization fails, it could lead to duplicate attributes being present.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings:normalizeAttributes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;`** - This method normalizes the attributes based on the parsing settings. If the settings are not applied correctly, it could lead to duplicates.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil:isBlank(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This utility method checks if a string is blank. It may be indirectly related to how attributes are processed and could affect the parsing logic.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil:isWhitespace(I)Z`** - Similar to the above, this method checks for whitespace characters, which could affect how attributes are parsed and normalized.\n\n9. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If the tokenization process does not handle attributes correctly, it could lead to duplicates.\n\n10. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)V`** - This method emits tokens, and if it does not handle the emission of attributes correctly, it could lead to duplicates.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [15, 16, 102, 81, 87, 252, 253, 1, 2, 170, 171]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure related to duplicate attributes."
