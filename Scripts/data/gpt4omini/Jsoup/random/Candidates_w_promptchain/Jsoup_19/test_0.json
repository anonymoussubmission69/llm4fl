    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesCustomProtocols` is failing when trying to clean HTML content using the `Jsoup.clean` method with a specific `Whitelist`. The test checks if certain protocols are preserved in the cleaned HTML output.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the cleaning process and protocol handling:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is directly responsible for cleaning the HTML content based on the provided whitelist.\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This is an overloaded version of the clean method that also calls the main clean method.\n3. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addProtocols(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`** - This method is responsible for adding protocols to the whitelist, which is crucial for the test's success.\n4. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I`** - This method is involved in copying nodes from the dirty document to the clean document, and it checks if the tags are safe based on the whitelist.\n5. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:createSafeElement(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Cleaner$ElementMeta;`** - This method creates a safe element based on the whitelist, which is essential for ensuring that the correct attributes and tags are preserved.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure of the test. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 170, 188, 190]\n}\n```"
