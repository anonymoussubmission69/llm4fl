    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesTextAfterData` is failing when it attempts to assert the equality of the parsed HTML document's output against an expected string. The failure likely stems from the parsing logic in the `Jsoup` library, particularly in the methods responsible for parsing HTML content.\n\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This is the entry point for parsing the HTML string. Any issues in parsing will originate here.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Z)V`** - The constructor initializes the parser with the HTML string and base URI. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to parsing errors.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for invoking the parsing logic. Any issues in the parsing logic will be evident here.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse()`** - This method contains the core parsing logic. If there are any bugs in how tags or text nodes are handled, it will affect the output.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseTextNode()`** - This method specifically handles the parsing of text nodes, which is crucial for the test case that deals with text content.\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()`** - This method normalizes the document structure. If the document is not normalized correctly, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate through the others, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 78]\n}\n```"
