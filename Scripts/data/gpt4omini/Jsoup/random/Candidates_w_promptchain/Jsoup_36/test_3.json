The logic within this method, particularly how it handles the regex matching and charset validation, could be the source of the fault.\n- **DataUtil.<clinit>()**: While this is a static initializer, if the pattern is incorrectly defined or initialized, it could lead to issues in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\nThus, the potential suspicious methods are ranked as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0]\n}\n``` \n\nThis ranking indicates that the `getCharsetFromContentType` method is the primary focus for fault analysis, while the static initializer should also be reviewed for any potential issues with the regex pattern."
