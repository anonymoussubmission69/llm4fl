The failure likely stems from the methods involved in parsing and manipulating the HTML structure.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:prepend(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;` (method_id: 120)** - This method is directly called in the test to prepend a new row to the table. If this method has a bug, it would directly affect the test outcome.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 4)** - This method is used within the `prepend` method to parse the HTML string. If there are issues in parsing the HTML correctly, it could lead to incorrect manipulation of the DOM.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendChild(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;` (method_id: 69)** - This method is responsible for adding a child node to the element. If the child is not added correctly, it could lead to an incorrect structure.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:html(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;)V` (method_id: 75)** - This method is used to generate the HTML output. If there are issues in how the HTML is constructed, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected output.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;)V` (method_id: 73)** - This method is responsible for generating the outer HTML representation of the element. Any issues here could also affect the final output.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 81)** - This method is called to normalize the document structure. If normalization is not handled correctly, it could lead to unexpected results in the final HTML.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [120, 4, 69, 75, 73, 81]\n}\n```"
