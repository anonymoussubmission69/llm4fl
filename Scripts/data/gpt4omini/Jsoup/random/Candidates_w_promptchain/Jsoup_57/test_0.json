    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testChainedRemoveAttributes` is attempting to remove multiple attributes from an HTML element and then assert that the resulting HTML matches the expected output. The test fails, indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output after the attribute removals.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Node:removeAttr(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;` (Method ID: 90)** - This method is responsible for removing an attribute from a node. Since the test is failing after multiple calls to `removeAttr`, this method is a primary candidate for investigation.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:removeIgnoreCase(Ljava/lang/String;)V` (Method ID: 61)** - This method is called within `removeAttr` to remove an attribute by its key, ignoring case. If there is an issue with how attributes are being matched or removed, this could lead to the test failure.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:put(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attribute;)V` (Method ID: 60)** - This method is responsible for adding attributes to the node. If attributes are not being added correctly, it could affect the removal process.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml()Ljava/lang/String;` (Method ID: 106)** - This method is used to get the outer HTML of the element after the attributes have been removed. If the HTML is not being generated correctly, it would lead to a mismatch in the expected output.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendChild(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;` (Method ID: 106)** - This method is involved in managing child nodes, which could indirectly affect the structure of the element and its attributes.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)V` (Method ID: 138)** - This method is responsible for emitting tokens during parsing. If the parsing logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect attribute handling.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;` (Method ID: 137)** - This method reads tokens from the input. If the reading process is not functioning correctly, it could lead to issues in how attributes are processed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [90, 61, 60, 106, 138, 137]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the test failure."
