If there is an issue with the URL or the connection itself, it could lead to an IOException.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:execute()Lorg/jsoup/Connection$Response;`** - This method executes the HTTP request and returns the response. Any issues during the execution, such as network problems or invalid responses, could result in an IOException.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput(Ljava/io/Reader;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method parses the input HTML and could throw an IOException if the input is malformed or if there are issues reading the input.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:parseInputStream(Ljava/io/InputStream;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/Parser;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input stream and could also throw an IOException if there are issues with the input stream.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:readToByteBuffer(Ljava/io/InputStream;I)Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;`** - This method reads data from the input stream into a ByteBuffer and could throw an IOException if there are issues reading from the stream.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Response:parse()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method parses the response and could throw an IOException if the response body cannot be read or parsed correctly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they are part of the process of connecting to a URL, executing a request, and parsing the response. Any failure in these methods could lead to the IOException observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 170, 2, 152, 153, 201]\n}\n```"
