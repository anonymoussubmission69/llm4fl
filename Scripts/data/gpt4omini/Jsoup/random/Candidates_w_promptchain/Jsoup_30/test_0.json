If it fails, it indicates that the HTML is not valid according to the specified rules.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 0)**: This method is called within the `isValid` method to parse the HTML content. If there are issues with the parsing logic, it could lead to the validation failure.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 3)**: This method is responsible for parsing the body fragment of the HTML. Any issues in this parsing could lead to incorrect document structure, affecting the validation.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:isValid(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;)Z` (method_id: 206)**: This method checks if the parsed document is valid according to the whitelist. If the document is not valid, it could indicate a problem with the cleaning process.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I` (method_id: 207)**: This method is responsible for copying safe nodes from the source to the destination. If it fails to copy nodes correctly, it could lead to an invalid document.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 189)**: This method checks if a tag is safe according to the whitelist. If it incorrectly identifies a tag as unsafe, it could lead to validation failures.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeAttribute(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attribute;)Z` (method_id: 190)**: This method checks if an attribute is safe for a given tag. If it fails, it could prevent valid attributes from being accepted.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 3, 206, 207, 189, 190]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the validation failure observed in the test."
