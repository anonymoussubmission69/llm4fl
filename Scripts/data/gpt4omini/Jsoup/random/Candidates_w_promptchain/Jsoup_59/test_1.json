The test specifically deals with handling control codes in attribute names, which suggests that the parsing logic is critical in this context.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse`** - This method initializes the parsing process and validates inputs. If there are issues with input handling, it could lead to parsing errors.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** - This method runs the parser, and any issues in token processing could lead to incorrect HTML structure.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process`** - This method processes tokens, and if it does not handle control codes correctly, it could lead to malformed HTML.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If it fails to recognize control codes, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$Tag:newAttribute`** - This method creates new attributes. If it mishandles control codes in attribute names, it could lead to incorrect attribute parsing.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they all play a role in the parsing process. A failure in any of these methods could propagate through the parsing logic, leading to the observed test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 88, 64, 10]\n}\n```"
