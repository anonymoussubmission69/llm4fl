    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 87 (normalizeAttributes)**: This method is crucial for normalizing attribute names. If it does not correctly normalize attributes (e.g., not lowercasing them), it could lead to duplicate attributes not being recognized. The current implementation seems to handle normalization but should ensure that it is called correctly in the parsing process.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: Ensure that `normalizeAttributes` is called before parsing attributes in the `parseInput` method.\n\n2. **Method ID 15 (parseInput)**: This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML. If it does not call the normalization method correctly, it could lead to duplicate attributes not being dropped. The method currently does not show any normalization logic.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: Modify the `parseInput` method to call `normalizeAttributes` on the attributes after they are parsed.\n\n3. **Method ID 252 (setTrackErrors)**: This method sets up error tracking. If it is not set up correctly, it may not capture the duplicate attribute error. The implementation seems fine, but it should be verified that it is called before parsing.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: Ensure that `setTrackErrors` is called with a valid value before invoking `parseInput`.\n\n4. **Method ID 16 (getErrors)**: This method retrieves the list of errors. If errors are not populated correctly, it could lead to test failures. The implementation appears straightforward.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: No changes needed unless the error tracking setup is incorrect.\n\n5. **Method ID 253 (normalize)**: This method normalizes the keys of attributes. If it does not correctly lower case the keys, it could lead to duplicate attributes not being recognized. The implementation seems to be correct.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: Ensure that this method is called during the attribute parsing process.\n\n6. **Method ID 102 (outerHtml)**: This method returns the outer HTML of an element. While it is less directly related to the parsing of attributes, if attributes are not normalized correctly, the output could be incorrect. The implementation seems fine.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: No changes needed unless the attributes are not normalized before this method is called.\n\n7. **Method ID 89 (noTracking)**: This method creates a new `ParseErrorList` without tracking. It is less suspicious since it does not directly affect the parsing of attributes. The implementation is straightforward.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: No changes needed.\n\n8. **Method ID 170 (read)**: This method reads tokens. While it is part of the parsing process, it is less likely to be the source of the issue with duplicate attributes. The implementation seems fine.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: No changes needed.\n\n9. **Method ID 171 (emit)**: This method emits tokens. It does not directly relate to attribute handling. The implementation appears to be correct.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: No changes needed.\n\n10. **Method ID 172 (emit with string)**: This method emits a string. It is the least suspicious as it does not deal with attributes or parsing directly. The implementation seems fine.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: No changes needed.\n\n### ReRanked Methods\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 253,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 252,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 89,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 170,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 171,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 172,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
