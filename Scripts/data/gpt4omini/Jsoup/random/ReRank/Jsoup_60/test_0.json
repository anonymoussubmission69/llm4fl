    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Test Analysis**: The test `testParsesSingleQuoteInContains` expects a `Selector.SelectorParseException` to be thrown when parsing a specific query. This indicates that the parsing logic is critical and any flaws in the parsing methods could lead to exceptions not being thrown as expected.\n\n2. **Method Analysis**:\n   - **Method 7** (`parse`): This method initializes the parsing process. If the `QueryParser` or its `parse` method has issues, it could lead to exceptions not being thrown. This method is indeed very suspicious.\n   - **Method 11** (`contains`): This method processes a specific type of query and checks for empty search text. If the input is malformed, it may not handle it correctly, which could lead to exceptions. This method is also quite suspicious.\n   - **Method 25** (`consumeElementSelector`): This method consumes elements from a queue. If the queue is not managed properly, it could lead to incorrect parsing. This method is less suspicious than the previous two but still important.\n   - **Method 22** (`chompBalanced`): This method is responsible for balancing characters in the query. If it fails to correctly identify the balance of quotes or parentheses, it could lead to parsing errors. This method is also suspicious but less so than the first three.\n   - **Method 2** (`notEmpty`): This method checks if a string is empty or null. While important, it is a utility method and does not directly relate to parsing logic, making it the least suspicious.\n\n### Re-Ranking and Potential Fixes\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n1. **Method 7**: Fix: Ensure that the `QueryParser` is correctly implemented and handles all edge cases, especially with quotes and parentheses.\n2. **Method 11**: Fix: Add more robust validation for the `searchText` to handle malformed inputs and ensure exceptions are thrown as expected.\n3. **Method 22**: Fix: Review the logic for balancing quotes and parentheses to ensure it correctly identifies when they are balanced.\n4. **Method 25**: Fix: Ensure that the queue management logic is robust and handles all edge cases to prevent incorrect parsing.\n5. **Method 2**: No fix needed as it is a utility method.\n\n### Final Output\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
