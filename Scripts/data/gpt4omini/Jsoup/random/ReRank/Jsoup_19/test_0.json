    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test case and the retrieved method bodies, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 170 - `addProtocols`**:\n   - **Analysis**: This method is responsible for adding protocols to attributes of tags. The logic seems to be incomplete as it does not handle the case where the `protocols` map already contains the `tagName` and `attrKey`. Additionally, it lacks proper error handling for invalid protocols.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the method correctly initializes the `attrMap` and `protSet` only if they do not already exist. Also, add error handling for invalid protocols.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 1.\n\n2. **Method ID 172 - `isSafeAttribute`**:\n   - **Analysis**: This method checks if an attribute is safe based on the protocols defined. The logic appears to be sound, but it relies heavily on the correctness of the `protocols` map. If the map is not correctly populated, it could lead to unsafe attributes being considered safe.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add validation to ensure that the `protocols` map is correctly populated before performing checks. Consider logging or throwing exceptions for invalid states.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 2.\n\n3. **Method ID 1 - `clean(String bodyHtml, String baseUri, Whitelist whitelist)`**:\n   - **Analysis**: This method cleans HTML content using a `Cleaner` and a `Whitelist`. It relies on the `addProtocols` and `isSafeAttribute` methods. If those methods have issues, this method will also produce incorrect results.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the `Whitelist` is correctly configured before calling the `Cleaner`. Add checks to validate the `bodyHtml` and `baseUri`.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 3.\n\n4. **Method ID 188 - `clean(Document dirtyDocument)`**:\n   - **Analysis**: This method creates a clean document from a dirty one. It does not directly handle protocols or attribute validation, making it less suspicious.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the `dirtyDocument` is valid and contains safe nodes before copying them to the clean document.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 4.\n\n5. **Method ID 2 - `clean(String bodyHtml, Whitelist whitelist)`**:\n   - **Analysis**: This method is a wrapper that calls another clean method. It does not introduce any new logic or validation, making it the least suspicious.\n   - **Potential Fix**: None needed, but ensure that the `whitelist` is valid before passing it to the other clean method.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains rank 5.\n\nBased on the analysis, the ranking remains the same. Here is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 170,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 172,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 188,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
