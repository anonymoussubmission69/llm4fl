    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test case and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method 2 (clean)**: This method is responsible for cleaning the HTML input. It directly calls the `parseBodyFragment` method and then uses a `Cleaner` to clean the parsed document. Given that the test fails when handling framesets, this method is highly suspicious as it is directly involved in the cleaning process.\n\n2. **Method 3 (clean)**: This method wraps the cleaning method and is responsible for calling `clean` with an empty base URI. It is less suspicious than Method 2 but still plays a crucial role in the cleaning operation.\n\n3. **Method 0 (parse)**: This method parses HTML without a base URI. It is indirectly related to the cleaning process and could contribute to the fault if the parsing does not handle framesets correctly. However, it is less suspicious than Methods 2 and 3.\n\n4. **Method 4 (parse)**: This method parses HTML with a base URI. Similar to Method 0, it is indirectly related but less likely to be the source of the fault. It is less suspicious than Method 0.\n\n5. **Method 14 (process)**: This method processes tokens but does not directly relate to the cleaning of HTML. It is less suspicious in the context of the failing test.\n\n6. **Method 22 (insert)**: This method inserts an element into a structure and is not directly related to the cleaning process, making it less suspicious.\n\n7. **Method 190 (copySafeNodes)**: This method copies safe nodes from one element to another. It does not directly relate to the cleaning of framesets and is the least suspicious.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **Method 2 (clean)**: Ensure that the `parseBodyFragment` method can handle framesets correctly. If it does not, modify it to properly parse framesets or handle them in a way that does not lead to invalid HTML.\n  \n- **Method 3 (clean)**: Consider adding validation for the base URI or modifying the method to handle cases where the base URI is empty, especially when dealing with framesets.\n\n- **Method 0 (parse)**: Review the parsing logic to ensure it can handle framesets correctly. If necessary, implement a mechanism to handle framesets when no base URI is provided.\n\n- **Method 4 (parse)**: Similar to Method 0, ensure that the parsing logic is robust enough to handle framesets when a base URI is provided.\n\n- **Methods 14, 22, and 190**: These methods are less likely to be the source of the fault, but it may be beneficial to review them for any indirect effects they may have on the cleaning process.\n\n### ReRanked Methods:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 190,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
