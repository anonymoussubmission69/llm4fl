    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `handlesInvalidAttributeNames` is checking for the presence of certain attributes in an HTML document parsed using Jsoup. The test is particularly focused on handling invalid attribute names, which suggests that the parsing logic and attribute handling methods are critical to its success.\n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **Method 85 (`tagName`)**: This method retrieves the tag name of an element. It is suspicious because if the tag name is not correctly parsed or if it interacts incorrectly with attributes, it could lead to failures in the test.\n\n2. **Method 1 (`parse(String html, String baseUri)`)**: This method is responsible for parsing HTML with a base URI. If the parsing logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect document structures, affecting attribute retrieval.\n\n3. **Method 3 (`parse(String input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors)`)**: Similar to method 1, this method initializes the parsing process. If there are issues in the initialization or if errors are not handled correctly, it could lead to failures.\n\n4. **Method 4 (`runParser`)**: This method runs the parser and processes tokens. If the token processing is incorrect, it could lead to malformed documents, which would affect attribute handling.\n\n5. **Method 2 (`initialiseParse`)**: This method initializes the parsing state. If the input or base URI is not validated correctly, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n6. **Method 48 (`hasKey`)**: This method checks if an attribute exists. If the attribute names are not handled correctly (e.g., case sensitivity), it could lead to false negatives in the test.\n\n7. **Method 71 (`attributes`)**: This method returns the attributes of an element. If the attributes are not populated correctly during parsing, it could lead to issues in the test.\n\n8. **Method 0 (`parse(String html)`)**: This is a simpler parse method that could be a wrapper around the more complex parsing logic. If it fails, it could affect all parsing operations.\n\n9. **Method 64 (`notNull`)**: This method checks for null objects. While important, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure unless null values are being passed unexpectedly.\n\n10. **Method 142 (`isBlank`)**: This method checks if a string is blank. Similar to method 64, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method retrieves the tag name of an element.
