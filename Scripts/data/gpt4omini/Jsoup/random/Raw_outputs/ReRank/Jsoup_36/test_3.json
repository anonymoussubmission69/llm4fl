"Based on the analysis of the test case and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Test Case Analysis**:\n   - The test case `shouldSelectFirstCharsetOnWeirdMultileCharsetsInMetaTags` is designed to check if the method `getCharsetFromContentType` correctly extracts the charset \"ISO-8859-1\" from a complex content type string.\n   - The assertion checks if the output of `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType` matches the expected charset.\n\n2. **Method Analysis**:\n   - **Method ID 1: `getCharsetFromContentType`**:\n     - This method uses a regex pattern to extract the charset from the content type string.\n     - It checks if the extracted charset is supported using `Charset.isSupported`.\n     - The regex pattern is case-insensitive and captures the charset correctly, but if the regex fails to match or if the charset is not supported, it returns null.\n     - Potential issues could arise if the regex pattern does not correctly capture the charset or if the charset is not recognized by `Charset.isSupported`.\n\n   - **Method ID 0: `DataUtil`**:\n     - This is a private constructor that initializes the regex pattern for charset extraction.\n     - It does not directly influence the outcome of the test but is essential for the functioning of `getCharsetFromContentType`.\n\n3. **Re-Ranking**:\n   - The method `getCharsetFromContentType` is more suspicious because it directly affects the test outcome. If there is an issue with the regex or charset validation, it will lead to test failure.\n   - The constructor `DataUtil` is less suspicious as it only initializes the regex pattern and does not contain logic that could fail.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- For `getCharsetFromContentType`, ensure that the regex pattern correctly captures all valid charset formats. Consider adding logging to help debug if the regex fails to match.\n- Validate the charset extraction logic to ensure it handles edge cases, such as multiple charsets or unexpected formats.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
