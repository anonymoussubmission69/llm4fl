"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test is attempting to select a `div` element that does not have the class `left`. The expected outcome is that one element is found, and its ID should be `1`. \n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **Method 4 (parse)**: This method is responsible for parsing the document. If it fails to parse correctly, it could lead to incorrect selections. The parsing logic seems to handle various cases, but if it doesn't correctly identify the structure of the HTML, it could lead to issues.\n\n2. **Method 5 (parseEndTag)**: This method handles the parsing of end tags. If it incorrectly processes end tags, it could lead to elements being improperly recognized. The logic appears to check for ignorable end tags, which is crucial for correct parsing.\n\n3. **Method 80 (select)**: This method selects elements based on a query. If the selection logic is flawed, it could lead to the test failing. However, it relies on the correctness of the parsing methods.\n\n4. **Method 99 (collect)**: This method collects elements based on an evaluator. While it is less directly related to the parsing, incorrect evaluation could impact the outcome.\n\n5. **Method 101 (first)**: This method retrieves the first element from a collection. If the collection is empty or incorrectly populated, it could lead to a failure in the test. This method is less suspicious since it is a simple retrieval.\n\n6. **Method 102 (size)**: This method returns the size of the collection. It is a simple getter and not directly suspicious.\n\n7. **Method 0 (parse)**: A simple wrapper around another parse method. Not directly suspicious.\n\n8. **Method 3 (parse)**: Initializes a parser and calls its parse method. Not directly suspicious.\n\n9. **Method 111 (select)**: Similar to method 80, it selects elements based on a query. It is less suspicious compared to the parsing methods.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods\n\nAfter analyzing the methods, the re-ranking based on their potential impact on the test outcome is as follows:\n\n1. **Method 4 (parse)**: Most suspicious due to its role in parsing the document.\n2. **Method 5 (parseEndTag)**: Second most suspicious as it directly affects the parsing of end tags.\n3. **Method 80 (select)**: Third, as it relies on the parsing methods.\n4. **Method 99 (collect)**: Fourth, as it collects elements based on evaluation.\n5. **Method 101 (first)**: Fifth, as it retrieves the first element but is less likely to cause failure.\n6. **Method 102 (size)**: Sixth, as it is a simple getter.\n7. **Method 0 (parse)**: Seventh, as it is a wrapper and not directly suspicious.\n8. **Method 3 (parse)**: Eighth, as it initializes a parser.\n9. **Method 111 (select)**: Ninth, as it is similar to method 80 but less suspicious.\n\n### Potential Fixes\n\n- **Method 4 (parse)**: Ensure that all HTML structures are correctly parsed, especially nested elements. Add logging to track parsing progress and identify where it might fail.\n  \n- **Method 5 (parseEndTag)**: Verify that the logic for handling end tags is robust. Consider adding checks for malformed HTML and ensure that all end tags are correctly matched.\n\n- **Method 80 (select)**: Ensure that the selection logic correctly interprets the query and that it is not affected by any parsing errors. \n\n- **Method 99 (collect)**: Review the evaluator logic to ensure it correctly identifies elements based on the criteria.\n\n- **Method 101 (first)**: Add a check to handle cases where the collection might be empty, and log a warning if it is.\n\n- **Method 102 (size)**: No changes needed as it is a simple getter.\n\n- **Method 0 (parse)**: No changes needed as it is a wrapper.\n\n- **Method 3 (parse)**: No changes needed as it initializes a parser.\n\n- **Method 111 (select)**: No changes needed as it is similar to method 80.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 99,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 101,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 102,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 111,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    }\n]\n```"
