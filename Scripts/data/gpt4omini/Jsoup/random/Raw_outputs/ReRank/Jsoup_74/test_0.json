"Based on the analysis of the test and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 0 (parse(String html))**: This method is the entry point for parsing HTML. It directly calls another parse method without any checks for invisible characters. **Potential Fix**: Implement a check for invisible characters before parsing the HTML.\n\n2. **Method ID 1 (parse(String html, String baseUri))**: This method initializes the parsing process. It uses a `HtmlTreeBuilder` which may not handle invisible characters correctly. **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the `HtmlTreeBuilder` is configured to handle invisible characters appropriately.\n\n3. **Method ID 3 (parse(Reader input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors, ParseSettings settings))**: This method initializes the parsing process but does not seem to handle invisible characters. **Potential Fix**: Add logic to handle invisible characters during initialization.\n\n4. **Method ID 4 (runParser())**: This method reads tokens and processes them. If it fails to handle invisible characters, it could lead to incorrect text output. **Potential Fix**: Modify the token processing to account for invisible characters.\n\n5. **Method ID 12 (process(Token token))**: This method processes tokens and may not handle invisible characters correctly. **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the token processing logic includes checks for invisible characters.\n\n6. **Method ID 85 (select(String cssQuery))**: This method selects elements based on a CSS query and is less suspicious in the context of the test. **Potential Fix**: No immediate fix needed, but ensure that the selection logic does not inadvertently include invisible characters.\n\n7. **Method ID 86 (appendChild(Node child))**: This method appends a child node and is not directly related to text normalization. **Potential Fix**: No immediate fix needed.\n\n8. **Method ID 87 (text())**: This method retrieves the text from nodes and is somewhat suspicious. **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the text retrieval logic normalizes invisible characters.\n\n9. **Method ID 136 (read())**: This method reads characters and emits tokens. It is less suspicious as it deals with reading input rather than processing it. **Potential Fix**: No immediate fix needed.\n\n10. **Method ID 137 (emit(Token token))**: This method emits tokens and is the least suspicious. **Potential Fix**: No immediate fix needed.\n\n### ReRanked Methods\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranked list of methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 86,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 136,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 137,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
