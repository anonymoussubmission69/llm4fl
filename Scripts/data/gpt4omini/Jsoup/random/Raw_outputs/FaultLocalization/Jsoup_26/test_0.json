"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `handlesFramesets` is designed to clean an HTML string containing framesets and expects the cleaned output to be an empty string. The test fails if the `clean` method does not properly handle framesets, which suggests that the methods involved in parsing and cleaning the HTML are critical to investigate.\n\nHere are the method bodies analyzed:\n\n1. **Method 2 (`clean(String bodyHtml, String baseUri, Whitelist whitelist)`)**: This method parses the HTML and cleans it using a `Cleaner` with a given `Whitelist`. It is directly involved in the cleaning process and is likely where the fault originates if framesets are not handled correctly.\n\n2. **Method 3 (`clean(String bodyHtml, Whitelist whitelist)`)**: This method is a wrapper that calls Method 2 with an empty base URI. It is less suspicious than Method 2 but still relevant since it directly calls the cleaning method.\n\n3. **Method 0 (`parse(String html)`)**: This method parses HTML without a base URI. It is indirectly related to the cleaning process, as it is used to parse the HTML before cleaning.\n\n4. **Method 4 (`parse(String html, String baseUri)`)**: Similar to Method 0, this method parses HTML with a base URI. It is also indirectly related but may not be the source of the fault.\n\n5. **Method 14 (`process(Token token)`)**: This method processes tokens but does not directly relate to the cleaning of HTML. It is less suspicious in the context of the failing test.\n\n6. **Method 22 (`insert(Element el)`)**: This method inserts an element into a structure. It is not directly related to the cleaning process and is therefore less suspicious.\n\n7. **Method 190 (`copySafeNodes(Element source, Element dest)`)**: This method copies safe nodes from one element to another. While it deals with elements, it does not directly relate to the cleaning of framesets and is the least suspicious.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for cleaning the HTML input, which is directly related to the test that fails when handling framesets.
