"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `handlesInvalidAttributeNames` is checking for the presence of certain attributes in an HTML document parsed using Jsoup. The test is particularly focused on handling invalid attribute names, which suggests that the parsing logic and attribute handling methods are critical to the test's success.\n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **Method 85 (`tagName`)**: This method retrieves the tag name of an element. It is suspicious because if the tag name is not correctly parsed or if the element does not exist, it could lead to incorrect behavior in the test.\n\n2. **Method 0 (`parse(String html)`)**: This method is responsible for parsing HTML. If there is an issue in parsing the HTML string, it could lead to the test failing. This method is fundamental to the test's success.\n\n3. **Method 1 (`parse(String html, String baseUri)`)**: Similar to method 0, this method also parses HTML but with a base URI. Any issues in parsing could directly affect the test.\n\n4. **Method 2 (`initialiseParse`)**: This method initializes the parsing process. It checks for null inputs, which is good, but if the initialization fails or if the input is malformed, it could lead to issues.\n\n5. **Method 3 (`parse`)**: This method calls `initialiseParse` and runs the parser. If the parser does not run correctly, it could lead to failures in the test.\n\n6. **Method 4 (`runParser`)**: This method processes tokens read by the tokenizer. If the tokenization fails or if it does not handle invalid tokens correctly, it could lead to issues in parsing attributes.\n\n7. **Method 71 (`attributes`)**: This method retrieves the attributes of an element. If the attributes are not correctly populated, it could lead to the test failing.\n\n8. **Method 48 (`hasKey`)**: This method checks if an attribute exists. If the attribute handling is incorrect, it could lead to false negatives in the test.\n\n9. **Method 64 (`notNull`)**: This method checks for null objects. While important, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure since it does not deal with parsing or attributes directly.\n\n10. **Method 142 (`isBlank`)**: This method checks if a string is blank. Similar to method 64, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 85,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Retrieves the tag name of an element.
