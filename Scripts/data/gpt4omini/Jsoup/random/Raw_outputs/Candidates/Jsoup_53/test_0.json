"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `attributeWithBrackets` is failing when trying to select elements from an HTML string using Jsoup. The specific assertions that are failing involve selecting `div` elements with specific `data` attributes that contain brackets and special characters.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include:\n\n1. `org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(String html)` - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string.\n2. `org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(String html, String baseUri)` - This method is responsible for the actual parsing logic.\n3. `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(String input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors)` - This method initializes the parsing process.\n4. `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse(String input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors)` - This method handles the parsing of the input.\n5. `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()` - This method runs the parser on the input.\n6. `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process(Token token)` - This method processes tokens read from the input.\n7. `org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()` - This method reads tokens from the input.\n8. `org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(String cssQuery, Element root)` - This method is responsible for selecting elements based on the CSS query.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, the methods that are most suspicious and need further analysis are those involved in parsing and token processing, as they directly relate to how the input HTML is interpreted and how the selection is performed.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 116, 151]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify any potential issues with how the HTML is parsed, especially with respect to handling special characters and brackets in attribute values."
