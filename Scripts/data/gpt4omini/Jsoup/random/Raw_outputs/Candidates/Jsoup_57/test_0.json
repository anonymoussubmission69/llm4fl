"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testChainedRemoveAttributes` is failing when trying to remove attributes from an HTML element. The test attempts to remove several attributes from an anchor (`<a>`) element and expects the final output to be `<a>Text</a>`. \n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed are primarily those related to the removal of attributes and the parsing of the HTML. The following methods are of particular interest:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Node:removeAttr(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;`** - This method is responsible for removing an attribute from a node. Since the test is failing during attribute removal, this method is critical to investigate.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:removeIgnoreCase(Ljava/lang/String;)V`** - This method is called by `removeAttr` to remove an attribute while ignoring case. If there is an issue with how attributes are being matched or removed, this could lead to the test failure.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:appendChild(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method is involved in appending child nodes to an element. If the structure of the element is not maintained correctly after attribute removal, it could affect the final output.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If the parsing is incorrect, it could lead to issues when trying to manipulate the resulting nodes.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called by `Jsoup.parse` and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues here could propagate to the `removeAttr` method.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method is part of the parsing process and could be relevant if there are issues with how the HTML is being interpreted.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z`** - This method processes tokens during parsing and could affect how attributes are handled.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [90, 61, 106, 0, 1, 4, 12]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
