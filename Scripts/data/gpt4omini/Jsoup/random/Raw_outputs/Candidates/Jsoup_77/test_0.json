"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `normalizesDiscordantTags` is failing due to an issue with the HTML parsing and normalization process. The expected output is not matching the actual output, indicating that there may be a problem in the methods responsible for parsing and normalizing the HTML content.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious for further analysis:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML input. If there is an issue with how the input is parsed, it could lead to incorrect output.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput`** - This method handles the actual parsing logic. Any issues here could directly affect the output of the `parse` method.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method is involved in the tree-building process of the parsed document. If the tree is not built correctly, it will affect the final output.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:insert`** - This method is responsible for inserting nodes into the document tree. If nodes are inserted incorrectly, it could lead to malformed HTML.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:popStackToClose`** - This method manages the closing of tags in the document tree. If tags are not closed properly, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 8, 164, 166]\n}\n```"
