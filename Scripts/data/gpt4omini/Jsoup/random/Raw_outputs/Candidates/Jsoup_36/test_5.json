"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldNotThrowExceptionOnEmptyCharset` is designed to check the behavior of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class when provided with specific input strings that represent content types with empty charset values.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the test is failing when it calls `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType` with the inputs `\"text/html; charset=\"` and `\"text/html; charset=;\"`. The method `getCharsetFromContentType` is responsible for parsing the charset from the content type string, and it uses a regular expression pattern defined in the class initializer.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V`** - This is the class initializer where the `charsetPattern` is defined. If there is an issue with the pattern itself, it could lead to incorrect behavior in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is directly invoked in the test and is responsible for extracting the charset from the content type string. Any logic errors or issues in handling edge cases (like empty charset) could lead to the test failure.\n\nGiven the context, both methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
