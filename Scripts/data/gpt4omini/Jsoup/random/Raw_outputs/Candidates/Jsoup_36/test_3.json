"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldSelectFirstCharsetOnWeirdMultileCharsetsInMetaTags` is asserting that the method `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType` returns the expected charset \"ISO-8859-1\" when provided with a specific content type string. \n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure is likely related to the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class. The method uses a regex pattern to extract the charset from the content type string and checks if the extracted charset is supported.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This is the method being tested, which contains the logic to extract and validate the charset.\n\nGiven that the test failure is directly related to the output of `getCharsetFromContentType`, this method is highly suspicious. Additionally, the static initializer is also relevant as it sets up the regex pattern used in the method.\n\nThus, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- `getCharsetFromContentType` (method_id: 1)\n- `<clinit>` (method_id: 0)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
