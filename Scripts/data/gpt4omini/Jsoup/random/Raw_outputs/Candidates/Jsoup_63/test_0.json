"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `selfClosingOnNonvoidIsError` is designed to check if a non-void HTML tag (in this case, `<div>`) is incorrectly treated as a self-closing tag. The test expects an error to be raised when parsing the input HTML string.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput` (method_id: 1)** - This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML string. Since the test is failing during parsing, this method is a primary candidate for investigation.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:getErrors` (method_id: 4)** - This method retrieves the list of errors encountered during parsing. It is essential to check how errors are being recorded and if the expected error is being generated.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:processStartTag` (method_id: 10)** - This method processes start tags. Since the test is concerned with the handling of a non-void tag as a self-closing tag, this method's logic should be examined.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$StartTag:isSelfClosing` (method_id: 55)** - This method checks if a tag is self-closing. It is crucial to ensure that the logic determining whether a tag is self-closing is functioning correctly.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$StartTag:normalName` (method_id: 53)** - This method retrieves the normalized name of the start tag. It is important to verify that the tag names are being normalized correctly, as this could affect the self-closing check.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit` (method_id: 124)** - This method emits tokens during parsing. If there is an issue with how tokens are emitted, it could lead to incorrect parsing behavior.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insertStartTag` (method_id: 22)** - This method inserts a start tag into the tree. It is important to check how tags are being inserted and if there are any conditions that could lead to incorrect handling of non-void tags.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 10, 55, 53, 124, 22]\n}\n```"
