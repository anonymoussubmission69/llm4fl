"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `parentlessToString` is designed to check the behavior of an `Element` after it has been removed from its parent. The test fails when it asserts the string representation of the `img` element after it has been removed.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:toString()` (method_id: 91)** - This method is directly involved in generating the string representation of the `Element`. Since the test fails on the assertion of the string output, this method is critical to investigate.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:remove()` (method_id: 66)** - This method is responsible for removing the element from its parent. Since the test involves removing the `img` element, understanding how this method works and its side effects is essential.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml()` (method_id: 75)** - This method is called by `toString()` to generate the HTML representation of the element. Any issues in this method could lead to incorrect string outputs.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()` (method_id: 97)** - This method is involved in normalizing the document structure, which may affect how elements are represented after modifications.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normaliseTextNodes(Element)` (method_id: 98)** - This method is responsible for normalizing text nodes within the document, which could indirectly affect the output of the `toString()` method.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:findFirstElementByTagName(String, Node)` (method_id: 100)** - This method is used to find elements by their tag name, which may be relevant if the `img` element's state is affected by its parent or document structure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [91, 66, 75, 97, 98, 100]\n}\n```"
