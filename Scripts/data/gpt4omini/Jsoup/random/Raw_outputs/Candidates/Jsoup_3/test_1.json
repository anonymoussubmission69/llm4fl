"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesNestedImplicitTable` is failing when trying to parse a nested HTML table structure. The test is asserting that the parsed HTML matches an expected output. The failure likely stems from the methods involved in parsing the HTML and handling the structure of the document.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in parsing and handling the document structure:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is the entry point for parsing the HTML string into a Document object.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Z)V`** - The constructor for the Parser, which initializes the parsing process.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method creates a new Parser instance and calls its parse method.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method contains the main logic for parsing the HTML content.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseStartTag()V`** - This method handles the parsing of start tags, which is crucial for correctly interpreting nested structures.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseEndTag()V`** - This method handles the parsing of end tags, which is also critical for nested structures.\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:popStackToClose(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Tag;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method manages the stack of elements during parsing, which is important for correctly closing tags in nested structures.\n8. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:addChildToParent(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Z)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method adds child elements to their parent, which is essential for maintaining the correct document structure.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and play a significant role in the parsing process, making them critical points for investigation to identify the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 8]\n}\n```"
