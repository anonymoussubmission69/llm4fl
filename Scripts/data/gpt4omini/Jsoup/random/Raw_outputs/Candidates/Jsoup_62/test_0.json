"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 1)** - This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML string. Since the test case is focused on parsing HTML, any issues in this method could directly affect the outcome of the test.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:settings(Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseSettings;)Lorg/jsoup/parser/Parser;` (method_id: 3)** - This method sets the parsing settings, including case sensitivity. The test case specifically mentions case sensitivity, making this method critical to investigate.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseSettings;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;` (method_id: 7)** - This method is called within `parseInput` and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues here could propagate and affect the final output.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)Z` (method_id: 16)** - This method processes tokens during parsing. If there are issues with how tokens are handled, it could lead to incorrect parsing results.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.StringUtil:normaliseWhitespace(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 180)** - This method is used to normalize whitespace in the output. If the output is not normalized correctly, it could lead to assertion failures in the test.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.helper.StringUtil:in(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 182)** - This method checks if a string is present in an array. It may be relevant if the parsing logic relies on specific tag names or attributes.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 3, 7, 16, 180, 182]\n}\n```"
