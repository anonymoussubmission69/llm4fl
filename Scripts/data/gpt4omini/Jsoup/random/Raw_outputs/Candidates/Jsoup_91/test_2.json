"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testBinaryResultThrows` is designed to check if an `IOException` is thrown when a binary file is provided as input. The expected message for the exception is \"Input is binary and unsupported\".\n2. The test attempts to execute a connection using `Jsoup.connect` and sends data with specific parameters.\n3. The exception is caught, and the test checks if the exception message matches the expected message.\n4. The test fails if the exception is not thrown or if the message does not match.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:execute()`** (method_id: 238): This method is responsible for executing the HTTP request. If there is an issue with how the request is being processed, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n- **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:data(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)`** (method_id: 237): This method is used to set the data for the request. If the data is not being set correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n- **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:response()`** (method_id: 239): This method retrieves the response from the executed connection. If the response handling is incorrect, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n- **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)`** (method_id: 175): This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML. If the parsing logic does not handle binary data correctly, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n- **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:parser(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Parser;)`** (method_id: 84): This method sets the parser for the document. If the parser is not set correctly, it could lead to issues during parsing.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [238, 237, 239, 175, 84]\n}\n```"
