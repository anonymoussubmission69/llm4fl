"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `convertsImageToImg` is failing due to an issue with the HTML parsing functionality provided by the Jsoup library. The test is asserting that a specific HTML string is converted correctly, but it seems that the parsing logic is not handling the `<image>` tag as expected, leading to the output not matching the expected result.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This is the entry point for parsing HTML strings. If there is an issue with how the HTML is parsed, it will affect all subsequent processing.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method is responsible for delegating the parsing to the `TreeBuilder`. Any issues here could propagate through the parsing process.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse`** - This method initializes the parsing process. If the initialization is incorrect, it could lead to parsing errors.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** - This method runs the actual parsing logic. Any issues in this method could directly affect how tags are processed.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process`** - This method processes tokens during parsing. If it does not handle the `<image>` tag correctly, it will lead to the observed failure.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insert`** - This method is responsible for inserting elements into the document structure. If it does not handle the `<image>` tag correctly, it could lead to incorrect document structure.\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If it does not recognize the `<image>` tag correctly, it will affect the entire parsing process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 12, 104]\n}\n```"
