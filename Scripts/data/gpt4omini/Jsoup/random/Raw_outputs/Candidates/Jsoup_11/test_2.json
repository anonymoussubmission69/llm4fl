"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is focused on selecting elements from an HTML document using various selectors, specifically using the `Jsoup` library.\n2. The test fails when trying to select elements with specific attributes or tags, indicating that there may be an issue with the parsing or selection logic in the `Jsoup` library.\n3. The methods involved in parsing the HTML and selecting elements are critical to the functionality being tested.\n\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called during the parsing process and is responsible for the actual parsing logic.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:matches(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`** - This method checks if the current position in the token queue matches a specific string, which is crucial for parsing.\n4. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is responsible for selecting elements based on the provided query.\n5. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:findElements()Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method finds elements based on the current token queue, which is essential for the selection process.\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method allows for selecting child elements from a specific element, which is part of the selection logic.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 52, 112, 113, 80]\n}\n```"
