"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIsValidDocument` is checking the validity of HTML documents using the `Cleaner` class, specifically the `isValid` method.\n2. The test fails when trying to validate a document that contains a `<script>` tag, which suggests that the issue may be related to how the `Cleaner` processes script tags or how the `Whitelist` is configured.\n3. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs during the parsing process, which involves several methods in the `TreeBuilder` and `HtmlTreeBuilder` classes.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n- `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:<init>()`\n- `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse`\n- `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`\n- `org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process`\n- `org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:insert`\n- `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:isValid`\n- `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes`\n\nThese methods are crucial as they are involved in the parsing and validation of the HTML content. The methods related to the `Cleaner` and `HtmlTreeBuilder` are particularly suspicious because they directly handle the validation logic.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis to find the fault:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 7, 183, 184]\n}\n```\n\n- **0**: `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:<init>()` - Constructor for initializing the tree builder.\n- **1**: `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse` - Initializes the parsing process.\n- **2**: `org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser` - Runs the parser which processes the tokens.\n- **7**: `org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process` - Processes tokens in the HTML tree builder.\n- **183**: `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:isValid` - Validates the document.\n- **184**: `org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes` - Copies safe nodes from the source to the destination.\n\nThese methods should be examined to understand how they handle the input and where the validation might be failing."
