"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `testParsesSingleQuoteInContains` is expected to throw a `Selector.SelectorParseException`. The test attempts to parse a query string that includes a single quote, which may lead to issues in the parsing logic.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;` (method_id: 7)** - This method is responsible for initiating the parsing of the query string. Any issues in parsing logic would likely originate here.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:contains(Z)V` (method_id: 11)** - This method handles the `:contains` selector, which is directly related to the test case. If there is a problem with how it processes the input string, it could lead to the expected exception.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeElementSelector()Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 25)** - This method consumes the element selector from the token queue. If it does not handle special characters (like quotes) correctly, it could cause parsing errors.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:chompBalanced(CC)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 22)** - This method is responsible for handling balanced characters, which may include quotes. If it fails to correctly process the input, it could lead to exceptions.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notEmpty(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 2)** - This validation method checks if a string is empty and throws an exception if it is. If the input string is not handled properly before this validation, it could lead to the expected exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [7, 11, 25, 22, 2]\n}\n```"
