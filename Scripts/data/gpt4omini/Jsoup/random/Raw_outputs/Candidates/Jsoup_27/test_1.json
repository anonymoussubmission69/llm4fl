"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test method `testCharset` is designed to validate the behavior of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class. The test checks various content type strings and their expected charset outputs.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is responsible for extracting the charset from the provided content type string.\n\n### Analysis of Suspicious Methods:\n- **Method ID 0 (`<clinit>()`)**: This method initializes the `charsetPattern`. If the pattern is incorrectly defined, it could lead to failures in matching the charset in the content type strings.\n- **Method ID 1 (`getCharsetFromContentType`)**: This method directly processes the input and returns the charset. If there are issues in the logic (e.g., incorrect regex matching, handling of edge cases), it could lead to the test failures observed.\n\nBoth methods are crucial in the context of the failing test, as they are directly involved in the functionality being tested.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
