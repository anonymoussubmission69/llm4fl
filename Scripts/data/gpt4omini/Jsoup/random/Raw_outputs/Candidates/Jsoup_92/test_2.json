"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML input. Since the test is checking for duplicate attributes, any issues in parsing could lead to incorrect handling of attributes.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:getErrors()Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;`** - This method retrieves the list of parsing errors. The test checks for the presence of a specific error message (\"Duplicate attribute\"), making this method crucial for understanding how errors are tracked.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method generates the outer HTML of an element. The test expects a specific output format, and any issues in this method could lead to discrepancies in the expected vs. actual output.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:normalize()V`** - This method normalizes the attributes of an element. Given that the test is concerned with duplicate attributes, normalization is key to ensuring that attributes are handled correctly.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.ParseErrorList:noTracking()Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;`** - This method creates a ParseErrorList that does not track errors. If the parser is not tracking errors correctly, it could lead to missing the detection of duplicate attributes.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.ParseSettings:normalizeAttributes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attributes;`** - This method normalizes the attributes based on the parsing settings. It is essential for ensuring that attributes are treated consistently.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token:asStartTag()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token$StartTag;`** - This method converts a token to a start tag. If there are issues in how tokens are processed, it could lead to incorrect attribute handling.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token:asEndTag()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token$EndTag;`** - Similar to the start tag method, this method converts a token to an end tag. Any issues here could also affect attribute handling.\n\n9. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If tokens are not read correctly, it could lead to incorrect parsing of attributes.\n\n10. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;)V`** - This method emits a token. If tokens are emitted incorrectly, it could lead to issues in how attributes are processed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [15, 16, 102, 87, 89, 252, 253, 170, 171, 172]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the parsing and handling of HTML attributes, and any faults in them could lead to the issues observed in the test."
