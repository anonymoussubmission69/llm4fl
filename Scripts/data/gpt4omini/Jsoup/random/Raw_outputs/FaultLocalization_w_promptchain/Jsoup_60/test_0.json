"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test is expecting a `Selector.SelectorParseException` when parsing a specific query string. The methods provided will be analyzed to determine which ones are most likely to be causing the failure.\n\n1. **Method 7: `parse(String query)`**\n   - This method creates a `QueryParser` instance and calls its `parse()` method. If the `QueryParser` is not handling the input correctly, it could lead to the expected exception not being thrown.\n   - **Suspiciousness Rank: 1**\n\n2. **Method 11: `contains(boolean own)`**\n   - This method processes a `:contains` query. It checks for empty search text and adds an evaluator. If the input query is malformed, it could lead to issues in parsing.\n   - **Suspiciousness Rank: 2**\n\n3. **Method 22: `chompBalanced(char open, char close)`**\n   - This method is responsible for handling balanced parentheses and quotes. If it does not correctly manage the depth of quotes or parentheses, it could lead to parsing errors.\n   - **Suspiciousness Rank: 3**\n\n4. **Method 25: `consumeElementSelector()`**\n   - This method consumes elements from a token queue. If it does not correctly identify the end of a selector, it could lead to malformed queries.\n   - **Suspiciousness Rank: 4**\n\n5. **Method 2: `notEmpty(String string, String msg)`**\n   - This method checks if a string is empty or null. While it is important for validation, it does not directly relate to the parsing logic and is less likely to be the source of the parsing exception.\n   - **Suspiciousness Rank: 5**\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The parse method creates a QueryParser instance and calls its parse method.
