"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test is focused on normalizing invisible characters in text parsed from HTML. The test checks if the invisible characters are removed and if the text is correctly represented without them. \n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods and their suspiciousness ranking:\n\n1. **Method ID 3**: `Document parse(Reader input, String baseUri, ParseErrorList errors, ParseSettings settings)`\n   - **Reasoning**: This method initializes the parsing process and calls `runParser()`. If there are issues in parsing, it could lead to incorrect text normalization. This is critical as it directly affects how the input is processed.\n   - **Rank**: 1\n\n2. **Method ID 4**: `protected void runParser()`\n   - **Reasoning**: This method processes tokens read from the input. If the tokenization is incorrect, it could lead to improper handling of invisible characters. This method is directly involved in the parsing logic.\n   - **Rank**: 2\n\n3. **Method ID 12**: `protected boolean process(Token token)`\n   - **Reasoning**: This method processes the current token and updates the state. If the state management is flawed, it could lead to incorrect parsing results, affecting the normalization of text.\n   - **Rank**: 3\n\n4. **Method ID 1**: `public static Document parse(String html, String baseUri)`\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is a higher-level entry point for parsing HTML. While it delegates to a tree builder, any issues in the tree building process could propagate errors in text normalization.\n   - **Rank**: 4\n\n5. **Method ID 0**: `public static Document parse(String html)`\n   - **Reasoning**: Similar to method ID 1, this method is an entry point but less complex. It relies on the other parsing methods, making it less suspicious on its own.\n   - **Rank**: 5\n\n6. **Method ID 85**: `public Elements select(String cssQuery)`\n   - **Reasoning**: This method selects elements based on a CSS query. While it is important for retrieving elements, it is less likely to directly affect text normalization unless the selection logic is flawed.\n   - **Rank**: 6\n\n7. **Method ID 86**: `public Element appendChild(Node child)`\n   - **Reasoning**: This method is responsible for appending child nodes. While it is important for the document structure, it does not directly relate to text normalization.\n   - **Rank**: 7\n\n8. **Method ID 87**: `public String text()`\n   - **Reasoning**: This method retrieves the text content. While it is crucial for the final output, it relies on the correctness of the parsing and tokenization processes. It is less suspicious as it is more of a consumer of the parsed data.\n   - **Rank**: 8\n\n9. **Method ID 136**: `Token read()`\n   - **Reasoning**: This method reads tokens from the input. While it is part of the parsing process, it is less directly related to the normalization of text.\n   - **Rank**: 9\n\n10. **Method ID 137**: `void emit(Token token)`\n    - **Reasoning**: This method emits tokens. It is part of the token management process but does not directly affect the parsing logic or text normalization.\n    - **Rank**: 10\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method initializes the parsing process and calls runParser().
