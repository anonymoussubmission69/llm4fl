"Based on the provided test body and the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are ranked from most to least suspicious regarding the failure of the test `dropsDuplicateAttributes()`:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 87,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method normalizeAttributes is responsible for normalizing attribute names. If it does not handle duplicate attributes correctly, it could lead to the test failing due to the presence of duplicate attributes in the HTML input.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 252,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The setTrackErrors method sets the error tracking for the parser. If the error tracking is not set correctly, it may not capture the duplicate attribute error, leading to a failure in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The parseInput method is responsible for parsing the HTML input. If it does not correctly handle duplicate attributes during parsing, it could lead to the test failing.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getErrors method retrieves the list of errors encountered during parsing. If this method does not return the correct errors, it could lead to the test failing.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are identified as suspicious based on their roles in handling attributes and errors during the parsing process, which are critical to the functionality being tested."
