"Based on the provided test body and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'contains' method is directly related to the test case which is checking for a specific string being contained within a query. If there is an issue with how the 'contains' method processes the input, it could lead to the SelectorParseException being thrown.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'findElements' method is responsible for parsing different selectors, including ':contains'. If this method does not correctly handle the ':contains' selector, it could lead to parsing errors.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'parse' method is responsible for initiating the parsing process. If there is an issue in how it delegates to other methods or handles the input, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'parse' method of the QueryParser class is responsible for creating a new QueryParser instance and calling its parse method. If there are issues with the initialization or the input query, it could lead to exceptions.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement with the parsing logic related to the test case, which is expected to throw a SelectorParseException when parsing a specific query."
