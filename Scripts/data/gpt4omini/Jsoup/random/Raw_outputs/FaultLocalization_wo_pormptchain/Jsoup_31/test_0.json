"Based on the provided test body and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method normaliseWhitespace is responsible for normalizing whitespace in a string. Given that the test is checking for the correct formatting of an XML declaration and body, any issues in whitespace normalization could lead to a failure in the expected output.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The html method in the Element class constructs the HTML representation of the element. If this method does not correctly handle whitespace or formatting, it could lead to discrepancies in the output, causing the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The outerHtml method in the Document class returns the outer HTML representation of the document. If this method does not correctly format the output, it could lead to a mismatch with the expected result in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The parseInput method in the Parser class is responsible for parsing the input string into a Document. If there are issues in how the input is parsed, it could lead to incorrect document structure, affecting the test outcome.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
