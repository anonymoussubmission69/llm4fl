"Based on the provided test body and the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 183,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method isValid(Document dirtyDocument) is responsible for validating the document against the whitelist. Since the test is checking for valid and invalid documents, any issues in this method could lead to incorrect validation results.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 184,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method copySafeNodes(Element source, Element dest) is responsible for copying nodes from the source to the destination while adhering to the whitelist rules. If there are issues in this method, it could lead to incorrect copying of nodes, affecting the validity of the document.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 182,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of the Cleaner class initializes the whitelist. If the whitelist is not set up correctly, it could lead to validation issues in the isValid method.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 167,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method addTags(String... tags) adds tags to the whitelist. If there are issues in this method, it could affect which tags are considered safe, leading to incorrect validation results.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the validation process of the document, which is the focus of the failing test."
