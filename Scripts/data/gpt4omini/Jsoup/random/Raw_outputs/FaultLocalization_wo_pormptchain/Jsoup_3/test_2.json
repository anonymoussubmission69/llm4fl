"Based on the provided test and the methods covered by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 120,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'prepend(String html)' is directly involved in the test case where a new row is being prepended to a table. If this method does not correctly handle the HTML string or the structure of the document, it could lead to the test failing.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'normalise()' is called within the 'prepend' method. If the normalization process does not correctly handle the document structure after prepending, it could lead to an incorrect HTML output, causing the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 78,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'createShell(String baseUri)' is responsible for creating the initial document structure. If this method does not set up the document correctly, it could affect how elements are added later, including the prepend operation.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parse()' is responsible for parsing the token queue into a document. If there are issues in parsing the HTML string correctly, it could lead to incorrect document structure, affecting the prepend operation.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the test case and their potential impact on the outcome of the test."
