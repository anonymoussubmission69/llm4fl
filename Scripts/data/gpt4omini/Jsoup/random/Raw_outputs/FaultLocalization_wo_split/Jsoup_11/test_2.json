"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 113,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for selecting elements based on a query. It processes the query and matches elements, which is critical for the test cases that involve selecting elements from the parsed document. If there is an issue in how elements are selected or filtered, it could lead to incorrect results in the tests.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 112,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method acts as a wrapper to create a Selector object and invoke its select method. If the Selector is not functioning correctly, it could propagate issues to the select method, affecting the test results. It is closely related to the suspicious method above.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if the current position in the queue matches the start of a tag. If it incorrectly identifies the start of a tag, it could lead to incorrect parsing of the HTML, which would affect the overall selection of elements in the tests.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method parses the HTML with a base URI. If there are issues in parsing, it could lead to incorrect document structure, affecting the subsequent element selection. However, it is less directly related to the test failures than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is a simpler version of the parse method without a base URI. While it is still important for parsing, it is less complex and less likely to be the direct cause of the test failures compared to the methods that handle selection.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is a simple wrapper around the select method of the Selector class. It is the least suspicious as it does not contain any complex logic and merely delegates the call. Any issues would likely stem from the methods it calls rather than this one.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
