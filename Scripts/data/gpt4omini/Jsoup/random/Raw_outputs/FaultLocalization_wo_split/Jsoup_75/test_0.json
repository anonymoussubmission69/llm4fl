"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test method `booleanAttributeOutput` is attempting to parse an HTML string and assert that the output matches an expected string. The stack trace indicates that there may be an issue with how the HTML is being parsed or how the attributes are being handled.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parse' initializes the parsing process and calls 'runParser'. If there are issues with how the input is being processed or if the document is not being constructed correctly, this could lead to incorrect output.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'runParser' method reads tokens and processes them. If the tokenization or processing logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect parsing results, which would affect the output of the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for parsing the HTML with a base URI. If the base URI handling is incorrect or if the tree builder is not set up properly, it could lead to issues in the parsed document.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'process' method is abstract and is likely overridden in subclasses. If the implementation of this method is incorrect, it could lead to parsing errors, but it is less directly involved than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method processes end tags. While it is important for correct parsing, it is more specialized and may not be the root cause of the issue unless there are specific problems with end tag handling.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is a simple wrapper around another parse method. It is less suspicious because it does not contain complex logic that could lead to parsing errors.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 80,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'outerHtml' method constructs a string representation of the HTML. While it is important for the output, it is less likely to be the source of the parsing issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 93,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'selectFirst' method is a utility for selecting elements. It is less likely to be the source of the issue since it does not directly deal with parsing logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
