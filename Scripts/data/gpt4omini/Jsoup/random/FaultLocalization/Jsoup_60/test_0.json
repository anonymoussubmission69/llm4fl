    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test is expecting a `Selector.SelectorParseException` when parsing a specific query string. The methods provided will be analyzed to determine which ones are most likely to be causing the failure.\n\n1. **Method 7: `parse(String query)`**\n   - This method creates a `QueryParser` instance and calls its `parse()` method. If the `QueryParser` is not handling the input correctly, it could lead to the expected exception not being thrown.\n   - **Suspiciousness**: High, as it directly initiates the parsing process.\n\n2. **Method 11: `contains(boolean own)`**\n   - This method processes a `:contains` query and checks if the search text is empty. If the input query is malformed, it may not handle it correctly, leading to exceptions.\n   - **Suspiciousness**: Medium, as it deals with query parsing but is not the entry point.\n\n3. **Method 25: `consumeElementSelector()`**\n   - This method consumes elements from a queue based on certain conditions. If the queue is not managed properly, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n   - **Suspiciousness**: Medium, as it deals with the structure of the query but is not directly related to the exception.\n\n4. **Method 22: `chompBalanced(char open, char close)`**\n   - This method is responsible for balancing characters in the query. If it fails to correctly identify the balance of quotes or parentheses, it could lead to parsing errors.\n   - **Suspiciousness**: Medium, as it handles the structure of the query but is not the main parsing method.\n\n5. **Method 2: `notEmpty(String string, String msg)`**\n   - This method checks if a string is empty or null. If it is called incorrectly or if the input is not validated before this check, it could lead to issues, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the parsing exception.\n   - **Suspiciousness**: Low, as it is a utility method and does not directly relate to parsing logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method initiates the parsing process and is directly responsible for handling the input query.
