"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testBinaryThrowsExceptionWhenTypeIgnored` is designed to check if an `IOException` is thrown when a binary file is processed. The test specifically checks for the message \"Input is binary and unsupported\". \n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods from the `org.jsoup` library, particularly those related to parsing and handling HTML content. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:execute()`** - This method is responsible for executing the HTTP request. If there is an issue with how the request is being handled, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n2. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:data()`** - This method is used to set the data for the request. If the data is not being set correctly, it could lead to issues when the request is executed.\n3. **`org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection:ignoreContentType()`** - This method allows the request to ignore the content type. If this is not set correctly, it could lead to the wrong handling of binary data.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput()`** - This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML. If the parsing logic does not handle binary data correctly, it could lead to the exception being thrown.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If it does not handle binary data correctly, it could lead to issues during parsing.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [239, 238, 237, 175, 124]\n}\n```"
