"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `booleanAttributeOutput` is failing due to an assertion that checks the outer HTML of an image element. The expected output does not match the actual output generated by the `Jsoup` library.\n\nThe following methods are involved in the process of parsing the HTML and generating the output:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a `Document` object.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method is called by `Jsoup.parse` and is responsible for initializing the parsing process.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method is responsible for the actual parsing of the HTML content.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** - This method runs the parser and processes tokens.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:processStartTag`** - This method processes start tags, which is crucial for handling the `<img>` tag in the test.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:processEndTag`** - This method processes end tags, which may also affect the output.\n7. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml`** - This method generates the outer HTML of the element, which is what the test is asserting against.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, the methods that are directly involved in parsing and generating the output for the `<img>` tag are particularly suspicious. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 80]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the discrepancy between the expected and actual output."
