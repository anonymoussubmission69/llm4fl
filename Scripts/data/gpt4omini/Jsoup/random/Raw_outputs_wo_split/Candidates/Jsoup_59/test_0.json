"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesControlCharactersAfterTagName` is failing when trying to clean an HTML string containing control characters. The test expects the output to be a sanitized version of the input HTML, but it seems that the cleaning process is not handling the control characters correctly.\n\nThe following methods are involved in the cleaning process and are therefore suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is responsible for cleaning the HTML input. It calls `parseBodyFragment`, which is crucial for understanding how the input is processed.\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method parses the body fragment of the HTML. It is directly called by the `clean` method and is essential for understanding how the input is transformed.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the body fragment and is called by `parseBodyFragment`. It is important to analyze how it handles the input.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/List;`** - This method is involved in parsing the HTML fragment and may also contribute to how control characters are processed.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the parser and processes tokens. It is critical to understand how it handles different types of tokens, especially those related to control characters.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 4, 3, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
