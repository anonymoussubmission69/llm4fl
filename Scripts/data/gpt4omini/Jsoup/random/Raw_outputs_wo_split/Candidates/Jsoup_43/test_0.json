"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testElementSiblingIndexSameContent` is designed to check the sibling index of elements parsed from a given HTML string. The test fails when it asserts the sibling index of the elements, indicating that there may be an issue with how sibling indices are calculated or assigned.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:elementSiblingIndex()`** (method_id: 90)\n   - This method is directly involved in calculating the sibling index of an element. If there is a fault in how sibling indices are determined, this method is likely the source of the issue.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:indexInList(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Ljava/util/List;)`** (method_id: 91)\n   - This private method is responsible for finding the index of an element in a list of elements. If the logic here is flawed, it could lead to incorrect sibling indices.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:equals(Ljava/lang/Object;)`** (method_id: 92)\n   - The equality check is crucial for determining if two elements are the same. If this method does not correctly identify equal elements, it could affect the index calculation.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:children()Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** (method_id: 87)\n   - This method retrieves the child elements of the current element. If the children are not correctly identified, it could lead to incorrect sibling indices.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:parent()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** (method_id: 86)\n   - This method retrieves the parent of the current element. If the parent-child relationship is not correctly established, it could affect sibling index calculations.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;)`** (method_id: 93)\n   - The constructor for the Document class initializes the document structure. If there are issues in how the document is parsed and structured, it could lead to incorrect sibling indices.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [90, 91, 92, 87, 86, 93]\n}\n```"
