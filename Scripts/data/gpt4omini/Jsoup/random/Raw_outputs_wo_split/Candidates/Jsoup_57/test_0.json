"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** (Method ID: 0)\n   - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If there are issues with the parsing logic, it could lead to incorrect document structure, which may affect subsequent operations.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** (Method ID: 1)\n   - Similar to the previous method, this method handles the parsing of the HTML string. Any issues here could propagate errors in the document structure.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseSettings;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** (Method ID: 3)\n   - This method is part of the parsing process and is responsible for building the document tree. Errors in this method could lead to incorrect document representation.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Node:removeAttr(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;`** (Method ID: 90)\n   - This method is called multiple times in the test to remove attributes from the element. If there are issues with how attributes are managed or removed, it could lead to unexpected results in the final output.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Attributes:removeIgnoreCase(Ljava/lang/String;)V`** (Method ID: 61)\n   - This method is responsible for removing attributes in a case-insensitive manner. If it fails to correctly identify and remove attributes, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected output.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml()Ljava/lang/String;`** (Not directly listed but relevant)\n   - This method is used to get the outer HTML of the element after attributes have been removed. If the previous methods fail, this method will return incorrect results.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 90, 61]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the parsing and manipulation of the HTML document, and any faults in them could lead to the failure observed in the test."
