"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testSupportsNonAsciiTags` is failing when trying to parse a string containing non-ASCII characters and select elements based on those tags. The failure occurs at the assertion `assertEquals(\"Yes\", els.text());`, indicating that the expected text is not matching the actual text extracted from the parsed document.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious for further analysis:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If it fails to handle non-ASCII characters correctly, it could lead to the test failure.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues in handling the input string could propagate to the Document creation.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/parser/ParseErrorList;)V`** - This method initializes the parsing process. If it does not correctly handle the input string, it could lead to incorrect parsing results.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser()V`** - This method runs the parser. If there are issues in processing tokens, especially with non-ASCII characters, it could affect the final output.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;`** - This method reads tokens from the input. If it does not correctly identify or handle non-ASCII characters, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is used to select elements based on the tag name. If the parsing did not correctly create elements with non-ASCII tag names, this selection will fail.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.select.Selector:select(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is responsible for executing the selection logic. If the input to this method is incorrect due to parsing issues, it could lead to the test failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 83, 136]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure related to handling non-ASCII characters in the input string."
