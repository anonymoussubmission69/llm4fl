"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testQuotedCharset` is designed to validate the behavior of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class. The test checks various content type strings and expects specific charset outputs. \n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is responsible for extracting the charset from the provided content type string.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`getCharsetFromContentType`**: This method is directly invoked in the test and is responsible for the logic that determines the charset from the content type. Any failure in this method could lead to the test failing.\n2. **`<clinit>`**: The static initializer sets up the `charsetPattern`, which is used in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method. If there is an issue with the pattern (e.g., incorrect regex), it could lead to unexpected behavior in the charset extraction.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are crucial for the functionality being tested. The `getCharsetFromContentType` method is the primary suspect, but the static initializer should also be reviewed to ensure that the pattern is correctly defined.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
