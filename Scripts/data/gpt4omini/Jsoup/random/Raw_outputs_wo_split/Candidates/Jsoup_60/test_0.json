"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `testParsesSingleQuoteInContains` is expected to throw a `Selector.SelectorParseException`. The test attempts to parse a query string that includes a single quote, which may lead to issues in the parsing logic.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Evaluator;` (method_id: 7)** - This method is responsible for initiating the parsing of the query string. Any issues in parsing would likely originate here.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.select.QueryParser:contains(Z)V` (method_id: 11)** - This method handles the `:contains` query, which is directly related to the test case. If there is a problem with how it processes the input string, it could lead to the expected exception.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:chompBalanced(CC)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 22)** - This method is involved in handling balanced characters, which may include quotes. If it does not handle quotes correctly, it could lead to parsing errors.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:consumeElementSelector()Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 25)** - This method consumes the element selector from the queue, and if it does not correctly handle the input with quotes, it could also contribute to the failure.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.helper.Validate:notEmpty(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 2)** - This method checks if a string is not empty and throws an exception if it is. If the input string is incorrectly processed and ends up being empty, this could lead to the expected exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [7, 11, 22, 25, 2]\n}\n```"
