"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testNormalisesStructure` is designed to check the normalization of an HTML document parsed by Jsoup. The test fails when comparing the expected output with the actual output of the `TextUtil.stripNewlines(doc.html())` method.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious for further analysis:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If there is an issue with how the HTML is parsed, it could lead to incorrect normalization.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called to normalize the document. If there are issues in how normalization is implemented, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected output.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normaliseTextNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)V`** - This method is responsible for normalizing text nodes within the document. If text nodes are not handled correctly, it could affect the final output.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:findFirstElementByTagName(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method is used to find specific elements in the document. If it fails to find or incorrectly processes elements, it could lead to issues in normalization.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:html()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method retrieves the HTML content of an element. If the HTML is not retrieved correctly, it could affect the output of the `stripNewlines` method.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;)V`** - This method is responsible for generating the outer HTML of an element. If there are issues in how the outer HTML is constructed, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.helper.StringUtil:normaliseWhitespace(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This utility method is used to normalize whitespace in strings. If it does not handle whitespace correctly, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 97, 98, 99, 92, 93, 129]\n}\n```"
