"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testIsValidDocument` is checking the validity of HTML documents using the `Cleaner` class, specifically the `isValid` method.\n2. The test fails when trying to validate a document that contains a `<script>` tag, which suggests that the issue may be related to how the `Cleaner` processes such tags.\n3. The `Cleaner` class interacts with the `Whitelist` class to determine which tags and attributes are allowed.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:isValid(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;)Z`**: This method is directly involved in the validation process.\n- **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I`**: This method is responsible for copying nodes and may be where the validation logic fails.\n- **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeTag(Ljava/lang/String;)Z`**: This method checks if a tag is safe, which is crucial for the validation process.\n- **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addTags([Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`**: This method allows adding tags to the whitelist, which may affect the validation logic.\n- **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read()Lorg/jsoup/parser/Token;`**: This method is responsible for reading tokens from the input, which may include the problematic `<script>` tag.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [183, 184, 171, 168, 127]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the test failure."
