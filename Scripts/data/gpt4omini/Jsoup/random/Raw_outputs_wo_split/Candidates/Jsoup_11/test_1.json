"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `notClass()` is attempting to parse an HTML string and select elements based on specific criteria. The test fails when it asserts the size of the selected elements and their ID. The methods involved in this process include parsing the HTML and selecting elements based on their attributes.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If there is an issue with how the HTML is parsed, it could lead to incorrect selections later.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup.parse` method and is responsible for the actual parsing logic. Any issues here could directly affect the resulting Document.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TokenQueue:matchesStartTag()Z`** - This method checks if the current position in the token queue matches the start of a tag. If it fails to correctly identify tags, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:select(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method is used to select elements based on a CSS query. If the selection logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.select.Collector:collect(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Evaluator;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/select/Elements;`** - This method collects elements based on the provided evaluator. If the evaluation logic is incorrect, it could lead to the wrong elements being selected.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method normalizes the document structure. If the document is not normalized correctly, it could affect how elements are selected.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:findFirstElementByTagName(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Node;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method finds the first element by tag name. If it fails to find the correct element, it could lead to assertion failures in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 52, 80, 99, 86, 89]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
