"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `normalizesDiscordantTags` is failing due to an issue with the HTML parsing process. The expected output is not matching the actual output, indicating that there may be a problem in the parsing logic or the handling of tags.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the parsing process:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is the entry point for parsing HTML and is crucial for the overall functionality.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput`** - This method is responsible for processing the input HTML string and is directly involved in the parsing logic.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:parse`** - This method is responsible for the actual parsing of the input and constructing the document tree.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:insert`** - This method is responsible for inserting nodes into the document tree, which is critical for the correct structure of the parsed document.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.XmlTreeBuilder:popStackToClose`** - This method handles closing tags and may be involved in the incorrect handling of tag normalization.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 8, 164, 166]\n}\n```"
