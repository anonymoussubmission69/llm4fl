"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `convertsImageToImg` is failing when trying to convert an HTML string containing `<image>` tags into a valid HTML structure. The expected output is `<img />\\n<svg>\\n <image />\\n</svg>`, but the actual output is not matching this expectation.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods from the `Jsoup` library, particularly those related to parsing HTML. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string. If there is an issue with how it handles certain tags, it could lead to the failure.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method is called by the `Jsoup:parse` method and is responsible for the actual parsing logic.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** - This method is responsible for running the parser and processing tokens. If it does not handle the `<image>` tag correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process`** - This method processes tokens and is crucial for determining how tags are handled during parsing. If it does not correctly identify or convert the `<image>` tag, it could lead to the observed failure.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read`** - This method reads tokens from the input and is essential for the parsing process. If it does not correctly identify the `<image>` tag, it could lead to incorrect parsing results.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could propagate through the parsing process, leading to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 9, 104]\n}\n```"
