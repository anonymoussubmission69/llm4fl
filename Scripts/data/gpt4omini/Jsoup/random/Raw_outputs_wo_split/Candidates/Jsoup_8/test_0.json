"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `parentlessToString` is failing when it attempts to assert the string representation of an `Element` after it has been removed from its parent. The relevant lines in the test indicate that the `toString()` method of the `Element` class is being called, which is expected to return a specific HTML representation.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:toString()`** - This method is directly invoked in the test and is responsible for generating the string representation of the element. Any issues in this method could lead to the test failure.\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:remove()`** - This method is called before the second assertion. It is crucial to understand how removing an element affects its state and what `toString()` returns afterward.\n3. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml()`** - This method is called within `toString()`. If there are issues in how `outerHtml()` constructs the HTML representation, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()`** - This method is called within the `toString()` method of the `Element`. If the normalization process is faulty, it could affect the final output of the `toString()` method.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [91, 66, 75, 97]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes the method IDs for `toString()`, `remove()`, `outerHtml()`, and `normalise()`, which are critical to understanding the failure in the test case."
