"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `relaxedBaseEntityMatchAndStrictExtendedMatch` is designed to validate the HTML parsing and entity handling functionality of the Jsoup library. The test specifically checks if the parsed HTML matches the expected normalized whitespace output.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Entities:loadEntities`** - This method is responsible for loading entity mappings, which are crucial for parsing HTML entities correctly.\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse`** - This method initiates the parsing of the HTML string, which is the entry point for the parsing process.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse`** - This method handles the actual parsing logic and is critical in determining how the HTML is processed.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:initialiseParse`** - This method sets up the parsing state and is essential for the correct initialization of the parsing process.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:runParser`** - This method executes the parsing logic and processes tokens, which is vital for the parsing outcome.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder:process`** - This method processes tokens and is responsible for building the HTML tree structure, which is crucial for the final output.\n7. **`org.jsoup.helper.StringUtil:normaliseWhitespace`** - This method normalizes whitespace in the output, which is directly related to the test's assertion.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could lead to the failure of the test. The focus should be on how entities are loaded, parsed, and how whitespace normalization is handled.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 135]\n}\n```"
