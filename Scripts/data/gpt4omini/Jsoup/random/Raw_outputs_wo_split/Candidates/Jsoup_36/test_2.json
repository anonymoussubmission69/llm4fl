"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldReturnNullForIllegalCharsetNames` is designed to check if the method `getCharsetFromContentType` from the `DataUtil` class correctly returns `null` for an invalid charset name. The stack trace indicates that the test failed when asserting that the return value was `null`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is responsible for extracting the charset from the content type string.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- `getCharsetFromContentType`: This method directly relates to the test case and is responsible for the logic that determines if a charset is valid or not. If it does not return `null` for the invalid input, it is likely the source of the fault.\n- The static initializer `<clinit>` is also relevant because it initializes the `charsetPattern`, which is used in `getCharsetFromContentType`. If the pattern is incorrectly defined, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the method.\n\nThus, the potential suspicious method IDs are:\n- Method ID 1: `getCharsetFromContentType`\n- Method ID 0: `<clinit>`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
