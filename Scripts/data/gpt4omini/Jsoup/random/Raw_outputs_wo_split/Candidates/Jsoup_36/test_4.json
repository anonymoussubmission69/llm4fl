"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testQuotedCharset` is designed to validate the behavior of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class. The test checks various content type strings and expects specific charset outputs.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **`DataUtil.<clinit>()`**: This is a static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`. If there is an issue with the pattern, it could lead to incorrect matching in the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n\n2. **`DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType(String)`**: This method is directly responsible for extracting the charset from the content type string. The logic within this method includes pattern matching and charset validation, which are critical to the test's success.\n\nGiven that the test is failing, the most suspicious methods to analyze further are:\n\n- `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType(String)`: This method is directly invoked in the test and is responsible for the output.\n- `DataUtil.<clinit>()`: This method initializes the pattern used in `getCharsetFromContentType`, and any issues here could propagate to the latter method.\n\nThus, the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
