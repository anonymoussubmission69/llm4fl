"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `shouldNotThrowExceptionOnEmptyCharset` is designed to check the behavior of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method in the `DataUtil` class when provided with specific input strings that represent content types with empty charset values.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the test is failing when it calls `DataUtil.getCharsetFromContentType` with the inputs `\"text/html; charset=\"` and `\"text/html; charset=;\"`. The expected output is `null`, but it seems that the method is not returning the expected result, which suggests a potential issue in the implementation of `getCharsetFromContentType`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - This is the static initializer for the `DataUtil` class, which initializes the `charsetPattern`.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This is the method being tested, which contains the logic to extract the charset from the content type.\n\nGiven that the test is failing on the `getCharsetFromContentType` method, it is crucial to analyze both methods, especially the second one, as it directly relates to the test case.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed:\n\n1. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:<clinit>()V` - The static initializer that sets up the `charsetPattern`. If the pattern is incorrect, it could lead to the failure of the `getCharsetFromContentType` method.\n2. `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil:getCharsetFromContentType(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` - The method under test that is expected to handle the input correctly and return `null` for the provided test cases.\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object summarizing the findings is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
