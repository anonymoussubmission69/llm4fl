"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testPrependRowToTable` is designed to prepend a new row to an HTML table and then assert that the resulting HTML structure is as expected. The failure likely stems from the methods involved in parsing and manipulating the HTML structure.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the HTML string into a Document object. If there is an issue with how the HTML is parsed, it could lead to incorrect behavior in subsequent operations.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:prepend(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method is directly called in the test to prepend a new row to the table. If there is a bug in this method, it would directly affect the outcome of the test.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseBodyFragment(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called within the `prepend` method to parse the HTML fragment being prepended. Any issues here could lead to incorrect parsing of the new row.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Document:normalise()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method is called to normalize the document structure. If the normalization process is flawed, it could result in an unexpected HTML structure.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:html()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is used to retrieve the HTML content of the element. If it does not return the expected structure, it could lead to assertion failures.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.nodes.Element:outerHtml(Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;)V`** - This method is responsible for generating the outer HTML representation of the element. If there are issues in how it constructs the HTML, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 120, 4, 81, 74, 73]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the test failure."
