"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesNestedImplicitTable` is failing when trying to parse an HTML string that contains nested tables. The test expects a specific output structure after parsing, which indicates that the parsing logic is likely where the issue lies.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in parsing the HTML:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:parse(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This is the entry point for parsing the HTML string.\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Z)V`** - The constructor for the `Parser` class, which initializes the parser with the HTML string.\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method calls the constructor and starts the parsing process.\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parse()Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Document;`** - This method contains the main logic for parsing the HTML content.\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseStartTag()V`** - This method handles the parsing of start tags, which is crucial for nested structures.\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseEndTag()V`** - This method handles the parsing of end tags, which is also critical for correctly closing nested elements.\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:popStackToClose(Lorg/jsoup/parser/Tag;)Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;`** - This method is responsible for managing the stack of elements during parsing, which is essential for nested structures.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and play a significant role in the parsing logic, which is where the fault is likely to be found.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11]\n}\n```"
