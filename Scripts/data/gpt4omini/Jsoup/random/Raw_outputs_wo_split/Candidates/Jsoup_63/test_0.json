"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `selfClosingOnNonvoidIsError` is designed to check if a non-void HTML tag (in this case, `<div>`) is incorrectly treated as a self-closing tag. The test expects an error to be thrown when parsing the input HTML string.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:parseInput` (method_id: 1)** - This method is responsible for parsing the input HTML string. Since the test is failing during parsing, this method is a primary candidate for investigation.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.parser.Parser:getErrors` (method_id: 4)** - This method retrieves the list of errors encountered during parsing. It is essential to check how errors are being tracked and reported.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:processStartTag` (method_id: 10)** - This method processes start tags during parsing. Since the test is concerned with the handling of a non-void tag, this method's implementation should be reviewed.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder:insertStartTag` (method_id: 22)** - This method is responsible for inserting start tags into the document structure. It may contain logic that incorrectly handles non-void tags.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token:isStartTag` (method_id: 43)** - This method checks if a token is a start tag. If the tokenization process is flawed, it could lead to incorrect parsing behavior.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.parser.Token$StartTag:isSelfClosing` (method_id: 55)** - This method checks if a start tag is self-closing. Since the test is specifically about self-closing behavior, this method is crucial to analyze.\n\n7. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:emit` (method_id: 124)** - This method emits tokens during parsing. If there is an issue with how tokens are emitted, it could lead to incorrect parsing results.\n\n8. **`org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser:read` (method_id: 123)** - This method reads tokens from the input. Any issues in reading tokens could directly affect the parsing outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 10, 22, 43, 55, 124, 123]\n}\n```"
