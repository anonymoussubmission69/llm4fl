"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `handlesCustomProtocols` is failing when trying to clean HTML content using the `Jsoup.clean` method. The test is specifically checking for the handling of custom protocols in image tags. \n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method is responsible for cleaning the HTML content based on the provided whitelist. Since the test is failing during the cleaning process, this method is a primary suspect.\n\n2. **`org.jsoup.Jsoup:clean(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;)Ljava/lang/String;`** - This is an overloaded version of the clean method that also needs to be analyzed as it is called in the test.\n\n3. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:addProtocols(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Whitelist;`** - This method is used to add custom protocols to the whitelist. Since the test is checking for custom protocols, this method is crucial to investigate.\n\n4. **`org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist:isSafeAttribute(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Attribute;)Z`** - This method checks if an attribute is safe according to the whitelist. It may be involved in determining whether the custom protocols are allowed.\n\n5. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:copySafeNodes(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)I`** - This method is responsible for copying safe nodes from the dirty document to the clean document. It may be relevant to the failure if it is not handling the custom protocols correctly.\n\n6. **`org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner:createSafeElement(Lorg/jsoup/nodes/Element;)Lorg/jsoup/safety/Cleaner$ElementMeta;`** - This method creates a safe element based on the source element. It may also play a role in the failure if it does not correctly enforce the protocols.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 168, 172, 188, 190]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be further analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
