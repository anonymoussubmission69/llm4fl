"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testExistingFilePattern` is failing because the assertion `assertTrue(\"option g not FileInputStream\", parsedReadableFileStream instanceof FileInputStream)` is returning false. This indicates that the object returned by `line.getOptionObject(\"g\")` is not an instance of `FileInputStream`, which is expected.\n\nThe stack trace points to the following line in the test:\n- `parsedReadableFileStream = line.getOptionObject(\"g\");`\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and could potentially lead to this issue include:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.cli.PatternOptionBuilder:parsePattern`** - This method is responsible for parsing the pattern and creating the options. If it does not correctly handle the input pattern, it could lead to incorrect option creation.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.cli.CommandLine:getParsedOptionValue`** - This method retrieves the value associated with the option. If it does not correctly resolve the option or its type, it could lead to the wrong object being returned.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.cli.TypeHandler:createValue`** - This method creates a value based on the type specified in the option. If the type is not correctly set or handled, it could return an incorrect object type.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.cli.CommandLine:getOptionObject`** - This method retrieves the object associated with the option. If the option is not correctly parsed or resolved, it could lead to returning an unexpected object.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.cli.CommandLine:resolveOption`** - This method resolves the option from the command line. If it fails to find the correct option, it could lead to incorrect behavior.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 1, 26, 14]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 0**: `PatternOptionBuilder:parsePattern` - Responsible for parsing the input pattern.\n- **Method ID 3**: `CommandLine:getParsedOptionValue` - Retrieves the value for the option.\n- **Method ID 1**: `TypeHandler:createValue` - Creates the value based on the type.\n- **Method ID 26**: `CommandLine:getOptionObject` - Gets the object for the option.\n- **Method ID 14**: `CommandLine:resolveOption` - Resolves the option from the command line input. \n\nThese methods are interconnected and could propagate the fault leading to the test failure."
