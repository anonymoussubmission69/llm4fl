"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the error is related to the `AlreadySelectedException`, which indicates that an option from a group has already been selected when trying to select another option from the same group. This suggests that the issue is likely related to how options and option groups are being managed in the code.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.cli.OptionGroup:setSelected(Option)`** - This method is directly involved in setting the selected option for a group and throws the `AlreadySelectedException`. It is crucial to understand how it manages the selection of options.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:updateRequiredOptions(Option)`** - This method updates the required options and calls `setSelected` on the `OptionGroup`. It is important to check how it determines which options are required and how it interacts with the `OptionGroup`.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:processProperties(Properties)`** - This method processes properties and calls `updateRequiredOptions`. It is essential to see how properties are being processed and if they lead to the selection of options that conflict.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:parse(Options, String[], Properties, boolean)`** - This method is responsible for parsing the command line options and may lead to the selection of options that could cause conflicts.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:processOption(String, ListIterator)`** - This method processes individual options and calls `updateRequiredOptions`, which could also lead to the selection of conflicting options.\n\n6. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:getOptionGroup(Option)`** - This method retrieves the option group for a given option, which is relevant for understanding how options are grouped and selected.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 2, 5, 13]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are interconnected and analyzing them should help in identifying the root cause of the fault."
