"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the failure occurred due to a `ComparisonFailure` indicating that the expected value was \"bar\" but the actual value was `null`. This suggests that there is a problem with the selection of an option in the `OptionGroup` class, specifically related to the `setSelected` method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `setSelected(Option option)`: This method is directly related to setting the selected option, and the failure indicates that it might not be setting the value correctly when the input is `null`.\n\n2. `addOption(Option option)`: This method adds an option to the group. If the option is not added correctly, it could lead to the selected option being `null`.\n\n3. `getSelected()`: This method retrieves the currently selected option. If the selected option is not set correctly, this method will return `null`, which is what the test is failing on.\n\n4. The constructor `OptionGroup()` initializes the option map. If there is an issue during initialization, it could affect the subsequent methods.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `setSelected(Option option)` (method_id: 0)\n- `addOption(Option option)` (method_id: 1)\n- `getSelected()` (method_id: 5)\n- `OptionGroup()` constructor (method_id: 2)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 5]\n}\n```"
