"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testStripLeadingHyphens` is designed to test the `stripLeadingHyphens` method from the `Util` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `NullPointerException` occurred at line 36 of the `Util` class, specifically within the `stripLeadingHyphens` method.\n3. The `stripLeadingHyphens` method is called with a `null` argument in the test, which leads to the exception.\n\nThe only covered method by the failed test is `stripLeadingHyphens`, which is directly responsible for the failure. \n\nGiven this information, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is:\n\n- `stripLeadingHyphens` (method_id: 0)\n\nThis method should be examined to ensure it properly handles `null` inputs to prevent `NullPointerException`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
