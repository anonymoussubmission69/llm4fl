However, it lacks a proper implementation for handling the conversion logic, as it only checks the type against various constants without returning a value for valid types. This could lead to unexpected behavior, especially since the test expects a ParseException to be thrown when an invalid string is provided for conversion to Integer. The absence of a return statement for valid cases and the lack of exception handling make this method highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
