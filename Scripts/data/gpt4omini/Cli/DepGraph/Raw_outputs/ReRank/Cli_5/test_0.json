"The method `stripLeadingHyphens` is designed to remove leading hyphens from a string. However, it currently does not handle null input, which leads to a `NullPointerException` when null is passed. Additionally, there is no return statement for cases where the string does not start with hyphens, which could lead to a compilation error or unexpected behavior.\n\n### Issues Identified:\n1. **Null Handling**: The method does not check if the input string is null, which causes a `NullPointerException`.\n2. **Return Statement**: There is no return statement for cases where the string does not start with hyphens, which could lead to a compilation error.\n\n### Suggested Fix:\nTo fix these issues, we can modify the method to include a null check and ensure that it returns the original string if it does not start with any hyphens.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the method:\n\n```java\nstatic String stripLeadingHyphens(String str) {\n    if (str == null) {\n        return null; // Handle null input\n    }\n    if (str.startsWith(\"--\")) {\n        return str.substring(2);\n    } else if (str.startsWith(\"-\")) {\n        return str.substring(1);\n    }\n    return str; // Return the original string if no leading hyphens\n}\n```\n\n### Re-Ranking:\nSince the method has a critical issue that leads to a `NullPointerException`, it remains the most suspicious method. There are no other methods provided to compare against, so the ranking remains unchanged.\n\n### Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
