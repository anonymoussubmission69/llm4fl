    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 4 - `setSelected`**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 1\n   - **Analysis**: The method checks if the selected option is null or matches the new option's key. If neither condition is met, it throws an `AlreadySelectedException`. The logic does not account for the scenario where multiple options are being selected from the same group, which is the root cause of the exception in the test.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Modify the method to allow for multiple selections or to handle the logic of already selected options more gracefully.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains 1.\n\n2. **Method ID 27 - `processProperties`**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 2\n   - **Analysis**: This method processes properties and adds options to the command line. However, it does not check if an option has already been selected before adding a new one, which could lead to the `AlreadySelectedException`.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Implement a check before adding an option to ensure that it does not conflict with already selected options in the `OptionGroup`.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains 2.\n\n3. **Method ID 2 - `parse`**:\n   - **Current Rank**: 3\n   - **Analysis**: This method is a wrapper that delegates to another parse method. It does not directly handle the selection logic or properties that lead to the exception. Therefore, it is less suspicious.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes needed as it does not directly contribute to the issue.\n   - **ReRank**: Remains 3.\n\nBased on the analysis, the ranking remains the same as the original:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 27,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
