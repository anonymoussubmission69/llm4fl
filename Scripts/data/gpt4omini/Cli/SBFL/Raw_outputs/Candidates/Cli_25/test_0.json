"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testLongLineChunkingIndentIgnored` is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output contains a specific description for the option, while the actual output has an unexpected format, indicating that the long description is not being handled correctly.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in generating the output:\n\n1. **`printHelp(PrintWriter pw, int width, String cmdLineSyntax, ...)`** - This method is responsible for printing the help message, including options and their descriptions.\n2. **`printOptions(PrintWriter pw, int width, Options options, ...)`** - This method prints the options, which includes formatting the descriptions.\n3. **`renderOptions(StringBuffer sb, int width, Options options, ...)`** - This method is responsible for rendering the options into a string buffer, which includes handling the descriptions.\n4. **`getDescription()`** - This method retrieves the description of an option, which is crucial for the output.\n5. **`printWrapped(PrintWriter pw, int width, String text)`** - This method is used to wrap the text for printing, which may affect how the description is formatted.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 0, 3, 1, 4]\n}\n```"
