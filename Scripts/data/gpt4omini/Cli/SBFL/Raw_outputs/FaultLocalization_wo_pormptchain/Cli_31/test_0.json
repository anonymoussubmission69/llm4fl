"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The printUsage method is responsible for formatting the usage message. The failure indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output, suggesting that this method may not be correctly appending the argument name.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The appendOption method is called within printUsage and is responsible for appending the option details to the StringBuffer. If the argument name is not being appended correctly, this method could be the source of the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The setArgName method sets the default argument name. If this method is not being called correctly or if the argument name is not set as expected, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The hasArgName method checks if the argument name is set.
