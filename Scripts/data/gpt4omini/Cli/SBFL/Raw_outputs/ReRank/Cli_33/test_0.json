"Based on the analysis of the test and the retrieved method bodies, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 2: `printHelp`**\n   - **Issue**: The method is responsible for printing the header and footer. The test failure indicates that there is an unexpected space in the output header.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the header is trimmed properly before being passed to `printWrapped`. This can be done by modifying the call to `printWrapped` to use `header.trim()`.\n\n2. **Method ID 7: `printWrapped`**\n   - **Issue**: This method wraps the text but does not handle leading/trailing spaces effectively.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Before rendering the text, ensure that the text passed to `renderWrappedText` is trimmed to avoid any leading spaces.\n\n3. **Method ID 9: `renderWrappedText`**\n   - **Issue**: This method relies on `findWrapPos` to determine where to wrap the text. If the wrapping position is incorrect, it could lead to formatting issues.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the text passed to this method is already trimmed and that the logic for determining the wrap position accounts for any leading spaces.\n\n4. **Method ID 10: `findWrapPos`**\n   - **Issue**: This method determines where to wrap the text but does not handle cases where the text might have leading spaces.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Consider adding logic to ignore leading spaces when determining the wrap position.\n\n5. **Method ID 11: `rtrim`**\n   - **Issue**: This method trims whitespace from the end of a string but does not affect the current test failure directly.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes needed, but ensure it is used appropriately in other methods to handle trailing spaces.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
