This suggests that the issue is likely related to how options and option groups are managed in the code.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.cli.OptionGroup:setSelected(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)V` (method_id: 37)** - This method is directly involved in setting the selected option for a group and throws the `AlreadySelectedException` if an option is already selected.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:addOption(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;` (method_id: 2)** - This method adds an option to the options collection and may influence how options are grouped and selected.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:addOptionGroup(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/OptionGroup;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;` (method_id: 21)** - This method adds an option group, which is relevant to how options are managed in groups.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:parse(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;[Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/Properties;Z)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/CommandLine;` (method_id: 15)** - This method is responsible for parsing the options and may be where the selection logic is applied.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:updateRequiredOptions(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)V` (method_id: 31)** - This method updates the required options and may also be involved in the selection logic.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [37, 2, 21, 15, 31]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are interconnected and analyzing them should help identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
