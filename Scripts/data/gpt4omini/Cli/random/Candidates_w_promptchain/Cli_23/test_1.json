This exception is raised in the `renderWrappedText` method of the `HelpFormatter` class, which is called during the execution of the `printHelp` method.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the following sequence of method calls:\n1. `printHelp` (HelpFormatter)\n2. `printHelp` (HelpFormatter)\n3. `renderOptions` (HelpFormatter)\n4. `renderWrappedText` (HelpFormatter)\n\nThe methods that are directly involved in this failure are:\n- `renderWrappedText`\n- `printHelp`\n- `renderOptions`\n\nAdditionally, the `addOption` methods in the `Options` class are also relevant because they are responsible for adding options that may lead to the long text being rendered.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. `renderWrappedText` (method_id: 24)\n2. `printHelp` (method_id: 17)\n3. `renderOptions` (method_id: 23)\n4. `addOption` (method_id: 0)\n5. `addOption` (method_id: 1)\n\nBased on this analysis, the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [24, 17, 23, 0, 1]\n}\n```"
