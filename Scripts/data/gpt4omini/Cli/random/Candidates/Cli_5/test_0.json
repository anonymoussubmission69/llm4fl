The test method `testStripLeadingHyphens` is designed to test the `stripLeadingHyphens` method from the `Util` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `NullPointerException` occurred at line 36 of the `Util` class, specifically within the `stripLeadingHyphens` method.\n3. The `stripLeadingHyphens` method is the only method covered by the failed test, and it is directly responsible for the exception.\n\nThe `stripLeadingHyphens` method does not handle the case where the input string is `null`, which leads to the `NullPointerException` when the test case `assertNull(Util.stripLeadingHyphens(null));` is executed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is:\n\n- `stripLeadingHyphens`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The potential suspicious method's id\n}\n```"
