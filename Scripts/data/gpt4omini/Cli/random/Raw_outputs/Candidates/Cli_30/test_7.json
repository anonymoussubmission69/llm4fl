"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the error is related to the `AlreadySelectedException`, which indicates that an option from a group has already been selected when trying to select another option from the same group. This suggests that the issue is likely related to the handling of option groups and their selection states.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.cli.OptionGroup:setSelected(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)V` (method_id: 37)** - This method is responsible for setting the selected option in an option group. The exception is thrown from this method, indicating that the logic for selecting options may be flawed.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:addOption(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;` (method_id: 2)** - This method adds an option to the options collection. It may be relevant to check how options are added and whether the group selection logic is correctly applied.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:processOption(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/ListIterator;)V` (method_id: 30)** - This method processes an option and may be involved in the logic that leads to the selection of options from groups.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:updateRequiredOptions(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)V` (method_id: 31)** - This method updates the required options and may also be involved in the selection logic of options.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:getOptionGroups()Ljava/util/Collection;` (method_id: 0)** - This method retrieves the option groups and may be relevant to understanding how options are organized and selected.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [37, 2, 30, 31, 0]\n}\n```"
