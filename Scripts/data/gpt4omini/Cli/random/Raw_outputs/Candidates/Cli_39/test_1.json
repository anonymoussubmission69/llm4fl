"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testExistingFilePattern` is failing because the assertion `assertTrue(\"option g not FileInputStream\", parsedReadableFileStream instanceof FileInputStream);` is not passing. This indicates that the object returned by `line.getOptionObject(\"g\")` is not an instance of `FileInputStream`, which is expected.\n\nThe stack trace points to the following line in the test:\n- `at org.apache.commons.cli.PatternOptionBuilderTest.testExistingFilePattern(PatternOptionBuilderTest.java:171)`\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods from the `Options`, `Option`, `Parser`, and `CommandLine` classes. The suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are those that are involved in the parsing and handling of options, particularly those related to the `getOptionObject` method and the `addOption` method.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods identified for further analysis:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:getOption(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;`** - This method retrieves an option based on its key, which is crucial for understanding how the option is being parsed.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.cli.CommandLine:getOptionObject(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method retrieves the object associated with the option, which is directly related to the failure.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.cli.CommandLine:getParsedOptionValue(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method is responsible for getting the parsed value of the option, which may affect the type returned.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.cli.PatternOptionBuilder:parsePattern(Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;`** - This method is responsible for parsing the pattern and creating the options, which may influence how the options are set up.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Option:getType()Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method returns the type of the option, which is relevant to the assertion that checks if the parsed object is a `FileInputStream`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 46, 48, 58, 11]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to determine why the expected type of `FileInputStream` is not being returned, leading to the test failure."
