"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testLongWithEqual` is failing due to an `UnrecognizedOptionException` being thrown when trying to parse the command line options. The exception indicates that the parser does not recognize the option `--foo=bar`.\n\nThe following methods are involved in the parsing process and are likely to be suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:parse(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;[Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/CommandLine;` (method_id: 2)** - This method is responsible for parsing the command line arguments and is directly involved in the failure.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:processOption(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/ListIterator;)V` (method_id: 4)** - This method processes individual options and checks if they are recognized. It throws the `UnrecognizedOptionException` if the option is not found.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:hasOption(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 10)** - This method checks if the options contain a specific option. It is called within `processOption` to determine if the option exists.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:addOption(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;ZLjava/lang/String;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;` (method_id: 6)** - This method adds options to the `Options` object. If the option was not added correctly, it could lead to the parser not recognizing it.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Option:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;ZLjava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 12)** - This constructor initializes an option and validates it. If there is an issue with how the option is created, it could lead to recognition issues.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 4, 10, 6, 12]\n}\n```"
