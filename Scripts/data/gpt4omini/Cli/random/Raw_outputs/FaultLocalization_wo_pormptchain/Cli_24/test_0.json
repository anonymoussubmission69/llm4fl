"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 23,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method renderWrappedText is directly involved in the exception thrown, as it attempts to handle text wrapping based on the provided width.
