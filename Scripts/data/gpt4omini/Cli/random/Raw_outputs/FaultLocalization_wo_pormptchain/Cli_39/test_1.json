"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getOptionObject retrieves the parsed option value. The test fails because the parsedReadableFileStream is expected to be an instance of FileInputStream, but it is not. This suggests that the issue may lie in how the option is being parsed or the type being returned.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 49,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getOptionValue retrieves the value associated with the given option. If the option is not correctly parsed or if the value is not of the expected type, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getParsedOptionValue takes an Option and attempts to retrieve its value. If the option is not correctly set up or if the type is incorrect, this could lead to the failure in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 58,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method parsePattern is responsible for parsing the pattern and creating options.
