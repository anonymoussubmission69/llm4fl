"Based on the provided stack trace and the methods covered by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 38,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method setSelected(Option option) in OptionGroup throws AlreadySelectedException if an option from the group has already been selected.
