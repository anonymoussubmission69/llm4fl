However, it lacks a proper implementation for handling the conversion logic, as it only checks for various types without returning a value or throwing an exception for unsupported types. This could lead to unexpected behavior, especially since the test expects a ParseException to be thrown when an invalid string is provided for conversion to Integer. The absence of exception handling or a return statement for unsupported types makes this method highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
