"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the error is related to the `AlreadySelectedException`, which indicates that an option from a group has already been selected when trying to select another option from the same group. This suggests that the issue is likely related to the handling of option groups and their selection logic.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.cli.OptionGroup:setSelected(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)V` (method_id: 37)** - This method is responsible for setting the selected option in an option group. The exception is thrown from this method when trying to select an option that conflicts with an already selected option.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:updateRequiredOptions(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)V` (method_id: 31)** - This method updates the required options and may interact with option groups, potentially leading to the exception if the logic is flawed.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:processOption(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/ListIterator;)V` (method_id: 30)** - This method processes an option and may call the `updateRequiredOptions` method, which could lead to the exception if the option being processed is already selected.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:addOptionGroup(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/OptionGroup;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;` (method_id: 21)** - This method adds an option group and may affect how options are managed within groups.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:addOption(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;` (method_id: 2)** - This method adds an option to the options collection and may also influence the selection logic.\n\n6. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:hasOption(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 22)** - This method checks if an option exists, which is relevant to the selection logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [37, 31, 30, 21, 2, 22]\n}\n```"
