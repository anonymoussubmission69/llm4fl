The failure indicates that the expected message was not returned, suggesting that the logic responsible for throwing this exception may not be functioning correctly.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'checkRequiredOptions' is responsible for checking if required options are present and throwing a 'MissingOptionException' if they are not.
