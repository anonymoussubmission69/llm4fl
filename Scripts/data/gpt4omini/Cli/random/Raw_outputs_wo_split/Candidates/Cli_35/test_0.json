"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testExactOptionNameMatch` is failing due to an `AmbiguousOptionException` being thrown when trying to parse the option `--prefix`. The stack trace indicates that the exception is raised in the `handleLongOptionWithoutEqual` method of the `DefaultParser` class, which is called from `handleLongOption`, and ultimately from `handleToken`.\n\nThe following methods are involved in the failure:\n\n1. **handleToken** (method_id: 29) - This method is responsible for processing tokens and calls `handleLongOption` for long options.\n2. **handleLongOption** (method_id: 30) - This method checks if the token has an equal sign and calls `handleLongOptionWithoutEqual` if it does not.\n3. **handleLongOptionWithoutEqual** (method_id: 31) - This method retrieves matching options and throws an `AmbiguousOptionException` if more than one match is found.\n\nAdditionally, the `getMatchingOptions` method (method_id: 4) is called within `handleLongOptionWithoutEqual` to find matching options for the provided token.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `handleToken` (method_id: 29)\n- `handleLongOption` (method_id: 30)\n- `handleLongOptionWithoutEqual` (method_id: 31)\n- `getMatchingOptions` (method_id: 4)\n\nThese methods are directly related to the parsing logic that leads to the ambiguous option exception.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [29, 30, 31, 4]\n}\n```"
