"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the error is related to the `AlreadySelectedException`, which indicates that an option from a group has already been selected when trying to select another option from the same group. This suggests that the methods involved in managing option groups and their selections are likely to be the source of the fault.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.cli.OptionGroup:setSelected(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)V` (method_id: 27)** - This method is responsible for setting the selected option in an option group. The exception indicates that this method may not be handling the selection logic correctly.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.cli.DefaultParser:updateRequiredOptions(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)V` (method_id: 40)** - This method updates the required options and interacts with option groups. It may be involved in the logic that leads to the exception being thrown.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.cli.DefaultParser:handleOption(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)V` (method_id: 39)** - This method handles the option and calls `updateRequiredOptions`, which could be a point of failure in the selection logic.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.cli.DefaultParser:handleToken(Ljava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 37)** - This method processes the tokens and could be responsible for invoking the selection of options, potentially leading to the exception.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.cli.DefaultParser:checkRequiredArgs()V` (method_id: 35)** - This method checks if the required arguments are present, which may also be related to the selection logic.\n\n6. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:addOptionGroup(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/OptionGroup;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;` (method_id: 15)** - This method adds an option group and may be relevant in the context of how options are grouped and selected.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [27, 40, 39, 37, 35, 15]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the `AlreadySelectedException` and ensure that the option selection logic is functioning as intended."
