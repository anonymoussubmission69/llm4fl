"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testTwoOptionsFromGroupWithProperties` is designed to check the behavior of command line options when certain properties are set. The test fails due to an `AlreadySelectedException`, which indicates that an option from a group has already been selected when another option is being processed.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `setSelected` method in the `OptionGroup` class, which is responsible for managing the selection of options within a group. The exception is thrown when an attempt is made to select an option that conflicts with an already selected option.\n\n3. The methods involved in the process of parsing options and managing their selection include:\n   - `setSelected` in `OptionGroup`\n   - `updateRequiredOptions` in `Parser`\n   - `processOption` in `Parser`\n   - `parse` in `Parser`\n   - `processProperties` in `Parser`\n\n4. The methods that are directly related to the failure and need further investigation are:\n   - `setSelected` (method_id: 37)\n   - `updateRequiredOptions` (method_id: 31)\n   - `processOption` (method_id: 30)\n   - `parse` (method_id: 15)\n   - `processProperties` (method_id: 17)\n\nThese methods are critical in understanding how options are being processed and how the selection logic is implemented, which ultimately leads to the exception being thrown.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [37, 31, 30, 15, 17]\n}\n```"
