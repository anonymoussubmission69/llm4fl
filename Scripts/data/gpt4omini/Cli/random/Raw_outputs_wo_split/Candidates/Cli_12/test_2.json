"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testLongWithEqual` is failing due to an `UnrecognizedOptionException` being thrown when trying to parse the command line options. The exception indicates that the parser does not recognize the option `--foo=bar`.\n\nThe following methods are involved in the parsing process and are likely candidates for further investigation:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:parse(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;[Ljava/lang/String;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/CommandLine;` (method_id: 2)** - This method is responsible for parsing the command line arguments against the provided options. It is crucial to check how it handles the options and if it correctly recognizes the long option `--foo`.\n\n2. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Parser:processOption(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/ListIterator;)V` (method_id: 4)** - This method processes individual options. It checks if the option exists and throws an `UnrecognizedOptionException` if it does not. This method should be analyzed to see why it fails to recognize the `--foo` option.\n\n3. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:hasOption(Ljava/lang/String;)Z` (method_id: 10)** - This method checks if the options contain a specific option. It is important to verify if the `--foo` option was added correctly to the options before parsing.\n\n4. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Options:addOption(Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Option;)Lorg/apache/commons/cli/Options;` (method_id: 7)** - This method adds an option to the options list. It should be checked to ensure that the `--foo` option is being added correctly.\n\n5. **`org.apache.commons.cli.Option:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;ZLjava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 12)** - This constructor initializes an option. It is important to ensure that the option is being created with the correct parameters.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 4, 10, 7, 12]\n}\n```"
