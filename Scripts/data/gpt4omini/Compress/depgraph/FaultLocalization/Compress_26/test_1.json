The test failure indicates that the expected number of bytes skipped was 10, but the actual result was 0. This suggests that the method may not be correctly handling the skipping logic, particularly in the loop where it checks if 'skipped' is 0 and breaks out of the loop prematurely. This could lead to the method returning an incorrect value, making it highly suspicious.",
