The test case 'sanitizeShortensString' expects a specific output after sanitization, but the actual output is longer than expected. This suggests that the method may not be correctly filtering out unwanted characters, particularly those in the 'SPECIALS' block. The presence of a 'continue' statement without a corresponding 'return' statement in the loop could lead to unexpected behavior, making this method highly suspicious.",
