"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the main issue arises from a `NumberFormatException` when trying to parse a string representation of a long value (specifically \"4294967294\") into an integer. This indicates that the method responsible for setting the group ID is likely trying to convert a long value to an integer, which is not appropriate for values larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (2147483647).\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method applies Pax headers to the current entry and specifically sets the group ID using Integer.parseInt(val). This is suspicious because it directly converts a string to an integer, which can lead to NumberFormatException if the value exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method adds Pax headers for big numbers, including the group ID. It is suspicious because it deals with long values but does not seem to handle the conversion properly, potentially leading to issues when the group ID exceeds the integer limit.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method parses Pax headers from an InputStream. It is less suspicious than the previous methods but still relevant as it is involved in reading the group ID value that causes the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method retrieves the next Tar entry and processes it. It is less suspicious because it does not directly handle the group ID conversion but is part of the flow that leads to the error.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method processes Pax headers and calls applyPaxHeadersToCurrentEntry. It is less suspicious as it does not directly deal with the group ID conversion but is part of the header processing.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method puts an archive entry and handles Pax headers. It is less suspicious as it does not directly deal with the group ID conversion but is part of the overall process.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method simply sets the group ID. It is the least suspicious because it does not perform any conversion or processing that could lead to the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
