"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testNineEmptyFiles` is failing due to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at `SevenZFile.readFilesInfo`. This suggests that there is an issue with how files are being processed, particularly when there are empty files involved.\n\nThe methods provided seem to be related to writing various attributes of files to a header, and they all interact with a collection of `SevenZArchiveEntry` objects. The methods that deal with empty files and streams are particularly suspicious, as they may not be handling cases where there are no files or empty files correctly.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFileEmptyFiles' checks for empty files and writes their information. If it does not handle the case where there are no files correctly, it could lead to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFileEmptyStreams' checks for empty streams. If it does not correctly identify when there are no streams, it could also lead to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFilesInfo' aggregates information from multiple methods. If any of the methods it calls (like writeFileEmptyFiles or writeFileEmptyStreams) fail, it could cause issues.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFileMTimes' processes last modified dates. If it does not handle cases where there are no entries correctly, it could lead to issues, but it is less likely to cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException directly.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFileNames' writes file names. If there are no files, it may not handle that case properly, but it is less directly related to the exception than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFileCTimes' processes creation dates. It is less likely to be the cause of the exception since it does not directly deal with empty files or streams.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFileATimes' processes access dates. Similar to writeFileCTimes, it is less likely to be the cause of the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFileWindowsAttributes' processes Windows attributes. It is the least likely to be related to the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
