"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCompress197` is failing due to an `IOException` that occurs while parsing the header of a tar entry. The stack trace indicates that the failure happens in the `getNextTarEntry()` method of the `TarArchiveInputStream` class.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`getNextTarEntry()`**: This method is directly involved in retrieving the next tar entry and is where the exception is thrown.\n2. **`getRecord()`**: This method is called within `getNextTarEntry()` to read the record, and any issues in reading the record could lead to the exception.\n3. **`parseOctal()`**: This method is used to parse octal values from the tar header, and if the header is malformed, it could lead to an exception.\n4. **`isEOFRecord()`**: This method checks if the record is an EOF record, which could affect the flow in `getNextTarEntry()`.\n5. **`readRecord()`**: This method is responsible for reading a record from the input stream, and any issues here could propagate up to the `getNextTarEntry()` method.\n\nGiven the relationships and the potential for exceptions to propagate, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 4, 8, 14, 15]\n}\n``` \n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Method ID 0 (`getNextTarEntry()`)**: Directly responsible for the failure.\n- **Method ID 4 (`getRecord()`)**: Called by `getNextTarEntry()`, could be the source of the issue.\n- **Method ID 8 (`readRecord()`)**: Responsible for reading records, which is critical for `getNextTarEntry()`.\n- **Method ID 14 (`isEOFRecord()`)**: Affects the logic in `getNextTarEntry()`, could lead to incorrect behavior.\n- **Method ID 15 (`parseOctal()`)**: Involved in parsing the header, which is where the exception is thrown. \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure."
