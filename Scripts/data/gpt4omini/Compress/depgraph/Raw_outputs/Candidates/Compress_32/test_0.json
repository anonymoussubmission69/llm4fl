"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`applyPaxHeadersToCurrentEntry(Map<String, String> headers)`** - This method attempts to set the group ID using `Integer.parseInt(val)`, which is where the `NumberFormatException` is thrown when the value exceeds the range of an integer.\n\n2. **`getNextTarEntry()`** - This method calls `paxHeaders()` which processes the headers and could lead to the `applyPaxHeadersToCurrentEntry` method being invoked with problematic data.\n\n3. **`paxHeaders()`** - This method is responsible for parsing the headers and could be the source of the problematic value being passed to `applyPaxHeadersToCurrentEntry`.\n\n4. **`parsePaxHeaders(InputStream i)`** - This method reads the input stream and constructs the headers. If it reads an invalid value, it could lead to the issues seen in the test.\n\n5. **`addPaxHeadersForBigNumbers(Map<String, String> paxHeaders, TarArchiveEntry entry)`** - This method adds headers for big numbers and could be involved in the process of setting the group ID.\n\n6. **`getLongGroupId()`** - This method retrieves the long group ID from the `TarArchiveEntry`, which is used in the test and could be returning an invalid value.\n\n7. **`setGroupId(long groupId)`** - This method sets the group ID and could be involved if the value being set is invalid.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 6, 16, 0, 1, 2, 21]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are interconnected, and the fault likely propagates through them, leading to the observed failure in the test."
