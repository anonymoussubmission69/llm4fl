"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is designed to check if a `NullPointerException` is thrown when instantiating the `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` class with a `null` input stream. The stack trace indicates that the test failed because the expected exception was not thrown.\n\nThe only covered method from the failed test is the constructor of the `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` class. This method is suspicious because it directly relates to the test case that is failing. The constructor takes a `Checksum` and an `InputStream` as parameters, and since the test is passing `null` for the `InputStream`, it is likely that the constructor does not handle this case properly, leading to the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The constructor of ChecksumCalculatingInputStream is suspicious\n}\n```"
