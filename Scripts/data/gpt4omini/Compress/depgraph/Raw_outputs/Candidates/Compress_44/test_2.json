"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is designed to check if a `NullPointerException` is thrown when instantiating the `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` class with `null` parameters. The stack trace indicates that the test failed because the expected exception was not thrown.\n\nThe only method covered by the failed test is the constructor of the `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` class. This constructor takes two parameters: a `Checksum` and an `InputStream`. Since the test is specifically checking for a `NullPointerException` when these parameters are `null`, this constructor is the primary suspect for the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The constructor of ChecksumCalculatingInputStream is suspicious\n}\n```"
