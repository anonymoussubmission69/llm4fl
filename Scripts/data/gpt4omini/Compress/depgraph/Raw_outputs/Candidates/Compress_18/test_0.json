"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testWriteNonAsciiDirectoryNamePosixMode` is attempting to write a non-ASCII directory name to a TAR archive using `TarArchiveOutputStream`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IOException` occurred while trying to write bytes that exceed the size in the header for an entry. This suggests that there is a mismatch between the expected size of the data being written and the size defined in the TAR entry header.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `writePaxHeaders`\n   - `putArchiveEntry`\n   - `write`\n4. The `writePaxHeaders` method is responsible for writing the headers for non-ASCII names, which is directly related to the test case.\n5. The `putArchiveEntry` method is responsible for preparing the entry for writing, and it calls `writePaxHeaders`.\n6. The `write` method is responsible for the actual writing of data, and it throws the exception indicating the size mismatch.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `writePaxHeaders` (method_id: 0)\n- `putArchiveEntry` (method_id: 1)\n- `write` (method_id: 2)\n- `setSize` (method_id: 21) - This method sets the size of the entry, which could be related to the size mismatch.\n- `getSize` (method_id: 37) - This method retrieves the size of the entry, which may also be relevant to the issue.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 21, 37]\n}\n```"
