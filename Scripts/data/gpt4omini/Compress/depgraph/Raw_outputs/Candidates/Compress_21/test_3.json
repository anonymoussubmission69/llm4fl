"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSevenEmptyFiles` is failing due to an `IOException` with the message \"Unknown property 128\". This indicates that there is an issue related to reading properties in the `SevenZFile` class, specifically in the method `readFilesInfo`.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the `SevenZFile` class, particularly in the `readFilesInfo`, `readHeader`, and `readHeaders` methods. These methods are responsible for reading the file information and headers, which are crucial for the functionality being tested.\n\n3. The test method `testCompress252` is called within `testSevenEmptyFiles`, which suggests that the issue may also be related to how files are being compressed or handled in that context.\n\n4. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods in the `SevenZOutputFile` class, which are responsible for writing various aspects of the archive, such as empty files, empty streams, and file information.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `readFilesInfo` (not covered in the failed test but crucial for understanding the failure)\n- `writeFileEmptyFiles`\n- `writeFileEmptyStreams`\n- `writeFilesInfo`\n- `writeHeader`\n- `writeFileNames`\n- `writeFileMTimes`\n- `writeFileCTimes`\n- `writeFileATimes`\n- `writeFileWindowsAttributes`\n\nThese methods are involved in the process of reading and writing file information, which is directly related to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 5, 14, 4, 3, 11, 12, 18, 10]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes methods that are directly involved in writing file information and those that are critical for reading the file properties, which are likely contributing to the failure."
