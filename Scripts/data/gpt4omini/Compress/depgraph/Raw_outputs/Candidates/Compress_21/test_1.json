"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`SevenZFile.readFilesInfo`** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace as the point where the `IOException` occurs due to an \"Unknown property\". This indicates that there might be an issue with how files are being read or processed.\n\n2. **`SevenZFile.readHeader`** - This method is called by `readFilesInfo`, and any issues in reading the header could propagate to the file reading process.\n\n3. **`SevenZFile.<init>`** - The constructor initializes the `SevenZFile` object and is responsible for setting up the file reading process. If there are issues with the initialization, it could lead to the errors observed.\n\n4. **`SevenZOutputFile.writeFilesInfo`** - This method is responsible for writing file information, and it calls several other methods that could also be contributing to the fault.\n\n5. **`SevenZOutputFile.writeFileEmptyFiles`** - This method is involved in writing information about empty files, which could be related to the properties being read.\n\n6. **`SevenZOutputFile.writeFileEmptyStreams`** - Similar to the above, this method deals with empty streams and could be related to the issue of unknown properties.\n\n7. **`SevenZOutputFile.writeFileMTimes`** - This method writes modification times and could be involved if the properties being read are related to timestamps.\n\n8. **`SevenZOutputFile.writeFileNames`** - This method writes file names and could also be a source of issues if the names are not being handled correctly.\n\n9. **`SevenZOutputFile.writeHeader`** - This method writes the header information and could be a source of the problem if the header is not being constructed correctly.\n\n10. **`SevenZOutputFile.finish`** - This method finalizes the writing process and could be involved if there are issues during the finalization.\n\nThe methods listed above are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 17, 18, 26]\n}\n```"
