"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testEightEmptyFiles` calls the method `testCompress252`, which is likely responsible for compressing files. The stack trace indicates that an `IOException` occurred due to an \"Unknown property\" while reading files info in the `SevenZFile` class.\n\n2. The methods involved in the stack trace that could potentially lead to this fault include:\n   - `SevenZFile.readFilesInfo`\n   - `SevenZFile.readHeader`\n   - `SevenZFile.<init>`\n   - `SevenZOutputFileTest.verifyCompress252`\n   - `SevenZOutputFileTest.testCompress252`\n   - `SevenZOutputFileTest.testEightEmptyFiles`\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `SevenZOutputFile` class, which are responsible for writing various aspects of the archive. The methods that are particularly suspicious due to their involvement in writing file information and handling empty files include:\n   - `writeFileEmptyFiles`\n   - `writeFileEmptyStreams`\n   - `writeFilesInfo`\n   - `writeFileNames`\n   - `writeFileMTimes`\n   - `writeFileCTimes`\n   - `writeFileATimes`\n   - `writeFileWindowsAttributes`\n\n4. The methods `writeFileEmptyFiles` and `writeFileEmptyStreams` are particularly relevant as they deal with empty files and streams, which could be directly related to the issue of \"Unknown property\".\n\n5. The method `writeFilesInfo` is also critical as it orchestrates the writing of various file-related information, including invoking the aforementioned methods.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 5, 4, 3, 11, 12, 18]\n}\n``` \n\n- **0**: `writeFileEmptyFiles`\n- **1**: `writeFileEmptyStreams`\n- **5**: `writeFilesInfo`\n- **4**: `writeFileNames`\n- **3**: `writeFileMTimes`\n- **11**: `writeFileCTimes`\n- **12**: `writeFileATimes`\n- **18**: `writeFileWindowsAttributes`\n\nThese methods should be analyzed to determine if they are contributing to the fault observed in the test."
