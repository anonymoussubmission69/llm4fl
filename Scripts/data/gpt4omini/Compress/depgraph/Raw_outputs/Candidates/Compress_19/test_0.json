"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testExcessDataInZip64ExtraField` is failing due to a `ZipException` that indicates a mismatch in the expected length of the central directory zip64 extended information extra field. This suggests that there is an issue with how the zip file's central directory data is being parsed or constructed.\n\n2. The stack trace points to several methods involved in the parsing and handling of zip64 extended information:\n   - `reparseCentralDirectoryData` is directly throwing the `ZipException`, indicating that it is likely where the fault originates.\n   - Other methods like `parseFromLocalFileData`, `parseFromCentralDirectoryData`, and the constructors of `ZipFile` and `Zip64ExtendedInformationExtraField` are also involved in the process leading up to the exception.\n\n3. The methods that need to be analyzed further include:\n   - `reparseCentralDirectoryData` (method_id: 2) - This method is directly responsible for checking the length of the raw central directory data and throwing the exception if there is a mismatch.\n   - `parseFromLocalFileData` (method_id: 1) - This method is involved in parsing local file data, which may contribute to the issue if the data is not being read correctly.\n   - `parseFromCentralDirectoryData` (method_id: 3) - This method is responsible for parsing the central directory data and may also be a source of the problem.\n   - Constructors of `ZipFile` (method_id: 0, 6, 7) - These methods initialize the `ZipFile` object and may be involved in setting up the state that leads to the exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7]\n}\n```"
