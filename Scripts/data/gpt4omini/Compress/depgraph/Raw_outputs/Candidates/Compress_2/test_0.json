"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testArDelete` is failing due to an assertion that expected `copied` to be `1`, but it was `0`. This indicates that the method responsible for copying the entries from the archive is not functioning as expected.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`getNextArEntry()`**: This method is responsible for retrieving the next entry in the archive. If it fails to return the expected entry, it could lead to the `copied` count being `0`.\n2. **`getNextEntry()`**: This method calls `getNextArEntry()`, so if there is an issue in `getNextArEntry()`, it will propagate here.\n3. **`read(byte[], int, int)`**: This method is responsible for reading bytes from the input stream. If it does not read correctly, it could affect the entries being processed.\n4. **`matches(byte[], int)`**: This method checks if the signature matches. If the signature does not match, it could lead to the failure of reading the correct entries.\n5. **`copy(InputStream, OutputStream)`**: This method is used to copy data from one stream to another. If it fails to copy the data correctly, it could also lead to the `copied` count being incorrect.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 10, 3, 1, 19]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
