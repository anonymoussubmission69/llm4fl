"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testListAllFilesWithNestedArchive` is failing due to an assertion that expected a size of 1 for `expectedExceptions`, but it received 0. This indicates that an exception that was anticipated during the processing of nested archives did not occur, which suggests that there may be an issue in the handling of nested archives.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`getNextZipEntry()`**: This method is responsible for retrieving the next entry in the zip file. If it fails to correctly identify or handle nested entries, it could lead to the absence of expected exceptions.\n   \n2. **`closeEntry()`**: This method is involved in closing the current entry in the zip stream. If there are issues with how entries are closed, it could affect the processing of nested entries.\n\n3. **`readDataDescriptor()`**: This method reads the data descriptor for the current entry. If it does not handle the data descriptor correctly, it could lead to incorrect behavior when reading nested archives.\n\n4. **`skip()`**: This method is used to skip bytes in the input stream. If it does not function correctly, it could lead to incorrect positioning in the stream, affecting the reading of nested entries.\n\n5. **`read()`**: This method reads bytes from the input stream. If it does not read the expected number of bytes, it could lead to incomplete processing of entries.\n\n6. **`createArchiveInputStream()`**: This method creates an instance of `ZipArchiveInputStream`. If there are issues in the creation of the input stream, it could affect the entire reading process.\n\n7. **`currentEntryHasOutstandingBytes()`**: This method checks if there are outstanding bytes for the current entry. If it returns incorrect results, it could lead to improper handling of entries.\n\n8. **`findEocdRecord()`**: This method is responsible for finding the end of central directory record. If it fails, it could lead to issues in reading the zip structure.\n\n9. **`readFully()`**: This method reads a specified number of bytes from the input stream. If it does not read the expected bytes, it could lead to incomplete data being processed.\n\n10. **`readFirstLocalFileHeader()`**: This method reads the first local file header. If it does not read the header correctly, it could lead to issues in processing the zip entries.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 29, 5, 19, 20]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test case."
