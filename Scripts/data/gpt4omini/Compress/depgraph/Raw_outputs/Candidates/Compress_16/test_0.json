"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `aiffFilesAreNoTARs` is failing because it is expected to throw an `ArchiveException` when trying to create an archive input stream from a non-archive file (AIFF file). The failure occurs at the line where `createArchiveInputStream` is called, indicating that this method is likely involved in the fault.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to archive input stream creation and matching signatures for different archive types. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`createArchiveInputStream(InputStream in)`** - This is the method directly invoked in the test and is responsible for determining if the input stream corresponds to a valid archive format.\n2. **`TarArchiveInputStream:matches(byte[] signature, int length)`** - This method checks if the input stream matches the TAR archive format.\n3. **`JarArchiveInputStream:matches(byte[] signature, int length)`** - This method checks if the input stream matches the JAR archive format.\n4. **`CpioArchiveInputStream:matches(byte[] signature, int length)`** - This method checks if the input stream matches the CPIO archive format.\n5. **`DumpArchiveInputStream:matches(byte[] buffer, int length)`** - This method checks if the input stream matches the DUMP archive format.\n6. **`ArArchiveInputStream:matches(byte[] signature, int length)`** - This method checks if the input stream matches the AR archive format.\n\nThese methods are responsible for validating the input stream against various archive formats, and any issues in their implementation could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]\n}\n```"
