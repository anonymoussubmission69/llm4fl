"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the `java.io.IOException: Unknown property 128` indicates that there is an issue with how file properties are being written or read, particularly in relation to empty files and streams. \n\n### Method Analysis and Potential Fixes\n\n1. **Method ID 5: `writeFilesInfo`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method writes various file information, including empty streams and files. If it incorrectly handles the properties of the files, it could lead to unknown properties being written, causing the IOException.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that all properties are correctly validated before writing. Add checks to confirm that the files being processed have valid properties and handle any discrepancies gracefully.\n\n2. **Method ID 1: `writeFileEmptyStreams`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method specifically handles empty streams. If it fails to correctly identify or write empty streams, it could contribute to the unknown property issue.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add logging to track which streams are identified as empty. Ensure that the logic correctly identifies all empty streams and handles them appropriately.\n\n3. **Method ID 0: `writeFileEmptyFiles`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method writes information about empty files. If it mismanages the empty files, it could lead to the IOException.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Similar to method 1, ensure that the method correctly identifies empty files and handles directories properly. Validate the `emptyFiles` BitSet before writing.\n\n4. **Method ID 14: `writeHeader`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method writes the header and calls other methods to write file information. If any of those methods fail or write incorrect data, it could lead to the IOException.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Implement error handling for the methods it calls. If any method fails, log the error and prevent writing the header until all data is confirmed valid.\n\n5. **Method ID 4: `writeFileNames`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method writes file names. If the names are not handled correctly, it could lead to issues, but it is less likely to cause an unknown property error compared to methods that handle empty files or streams.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that file names are properly encoded and check for null or invalid names before writing.\n\n6. **Method ID 3: `writeFileMTimes`**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method writes last modified times. While it is important, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the unknown property error compared to methods that handle empty files or streams.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Validate that the last modified dates are correctly set and handle cases where they may not be available.\n\n7. **Method ID 11, 12, 18: Incomplete Methods**\n   - **Reasoning**: These methods are incomplete and do not perform any actions. They are unlikely to be the cause of the error.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Complete these methods to ensure they handle their respective properties correctly.\n\n8. **Method ID 10: Constructor**\n   - **Reasoning**: This method initializes the class and does not directly deal with file properties. It is the least suspicious in relation to the IOException.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the initialization is robust and that any required properties are set correctly.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods\n\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 10\n    }\n]\n```"
