The stack trace indicates that the test failed because the expected exception was not thrown.\n\nThe only covered method by the failed test is the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`, which is as follows:\n\n```java\npublic ChecksumCalculatingInputStream(final Checksum checksum, final InputStream in) {\n    this.checksum = checksum;\n    this.in = in;\n}\n```\n\nIn this constructor, if either `checksum` or `in` is `null`, it is expected to throw a `NullPointerException`. Since the test is specifically checking for this scenario, the constructor is the primary suspect for the fault.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe suspicious method that needs to be analyzed is the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The constructor of ChecksumCalculatingInputStream\n}\n```"
