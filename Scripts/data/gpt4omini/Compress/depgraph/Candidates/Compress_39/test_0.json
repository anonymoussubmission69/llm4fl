The expected output is a shortened string, while the actual output is longer than expected, indicating that the `sanitize` method is not functioning as intended.\n\nThe covered method identified is:\n- `org.apache.commons.compress.utils.ArchiveUtils:sanitize(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 0)\n\nThis method is responsible for sanitizing the input string, and since the test is failing due to the output of this method, it is highly suspicious and should be analyzed further.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
