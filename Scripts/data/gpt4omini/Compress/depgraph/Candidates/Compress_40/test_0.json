    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `bigEndianWithOverflow` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected value `8274274654740644818` with the actual value `203824122492715986`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue in the method responsible for reading bits from the input stream, specifically in the `readBits(int count)` method of the `BitInputStream` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `readBits(int count)` - This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for reading bits from the input stream. The logic within this method is crucial to understanding why the expected and actual values differ.\n\n2. `BitInputStream(InputStream in, ByteOrder byteOrder)` - This constructor initializes the `BitInputStream` object. While it may not directly cause the failure, any issues in the initialization could affect the behavior of the `readBits` method.\n\n3. `<clinit>()` - This static initializer sets up constants used in the class. Although it is less likely to be the source of the fault, it is still relevant to the overall functionality of the class.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be examined further are:\n\n- `readBits(int count)` (method_id: 0)\n- `BitInputStream(InputStream in, ByteOrder byteOrder)` (method_id: 1)\n- `<clinit>()` (method_id: 2)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
