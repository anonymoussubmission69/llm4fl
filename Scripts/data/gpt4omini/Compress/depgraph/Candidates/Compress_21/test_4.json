The test `testSixEmptyFiles` calls the method `testCompress252`, which is where the failure occurs.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IOException` is thrown due to a \"Badly terminated header\" while reading the header in the `SevenZFile` class.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `SevenZFile.readHeader`\n   - `SevenZFile.readHeaders`\n   - `SevenZFile.<init>`\n   - `SevenZOutputFileTest.verifyCompress252`\n   - `SevenZOutputFileTest.testCompress252`\n   - `SevenZOutputFileTest.testSixEmptyFiles`\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are particularly suspicious as they are related to writing files and headers, which could lead to the \"Badly terminated header\" issue:\n\n1. `writeFileEmptyFiles`\n2. `writeFileEmptyStreams`\n3. `finish`\n4. `writeFilesInfo`\n5. `writeHeader`\n\nThese methods are responsible for writing various aspects of the archive, and any issues in their implementation could lead to the header being improperly formed, resulting in the IOException observed.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 14, 5, 15]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method IDs correspond to:\n  - 0: `writeFileEmptyFiles`\n  - 1: `writeFileEmptyStreams`\n  - 5: `writeFilesInfo`\n  - 14: `writeHeader`\n  - 15: `finish` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure."
