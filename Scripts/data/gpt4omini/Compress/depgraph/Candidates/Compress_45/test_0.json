    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n1. **formatBigIntegerBinary**: This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace as throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`. It is responsible for formatting a `BigInteger` into a binary representation, and the exception indicates that the value being processed is too large for the expected size.\n\n2. **formatLongOctalOrBinaryBytes**: This method calls `formatBigIntegerBinary` and is involved in the process of formatting long values into octal or binary bytes. It is likely to propagate the issue if the input value is too large.\n\n3. **formatLongBinary**: This method is called by `formatLongOctalOrBinaryBytes` and handles the binary formatting of long values. It may also contribute to the issue if it does not properly handle large values.\n\n4. **parseBinaryLong**: This method is responsible for parsing binary long values from a byte array. If the input data is malformed or exceeds expected limits, it could lead to issues.\n\n5. **parseOctalOrBinary**: This method is responsible for determining whether to parse a value as octal or binary. It calls `parseBinaryLong`, which could lead to the same issues if the input is not valid.\n\n6. **parseOctal**: This method parses octal values and could also be involved if the input data is not formatted correctly.\n\nGiven the relationships between these methods, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test case."
