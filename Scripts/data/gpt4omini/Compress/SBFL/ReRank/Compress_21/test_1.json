    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The error `java.io.IOException: Unknown property 128` indicates that the `readFilesInfo` method is encountering an unexpected property type while reading file information. This suggests that the method is not handling all possible property types correctly.\n\n2. The `readStreamsInfo` method is responsible for reading stream information, which is crucial for the subsequent processing in `readFilesInfo`. If it does not read the stream information correctly, it could lead to the unknown property error.\n\n3. The `writeFilesInfo` method writes file information to a data output stream. If the properties being written do not match the expected format or values, it could lead to inconsistencies when reading them back.\n\n4. The `writeHeader` method constructs the header information, which includes streams and files info. If the header is not constructed correctly, it could lead to issues when reading the header.\n\n5. The `finish` method finalizes the writing process and includes writing the header. Any issues in finalization could affect the integrity of the data being read.\n\n6. The `createArchiveEntry` method creates a new archive entry. While it is not directly related to reading properties, if the entries are not created correctly, it could lead to issues later in processing.\n\n7. The `getName` method simply returns the name of an entry and is unlikely to be the source of the error.\n\n8. The `write` method is a basic write operation and is the least suspicious as it does not involve any complex logic or property handling.\n\n### Suggested Fixes\n\n1. **Method ID 36 (readFilesInfo)**: \n   - Add validation for the property type before processing. Ensure that all expected property types are handled, and provide a default case to manage unexpected types.\n   - Example fix:\n     ```java\n     if (propertyType < 0 || propertyType > MAX_PROPERTY_TYPE) {\n         throw new IOException(\"Unknown property \" + propertyType);\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Method ID 35 (readStreamsInfo)**:\n   - Ensure that all stream information is read correctly and handle cases where the expected information is not present.\n   - Example fix:\n     ```java\n     if (nid != NID.kEnd) {\n         throw new IOException(\"Unexpected end of stream information\");\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Method ID 22 (writeFilesInfo)**:\n   - Validate the properties being written to ensure they conform to expected formats.\n   - Example fix:\n     ```java\n     if (files.size() == 0) {\n         throw new IOException(\"No files to write\");\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Method ID 19 (writeHeader)**:\n   - Ensure that the header is constructed correctly and all necessary information is included.\n   - Example fix:\n     ```java\n     if (header == null) {\n         throw new IOException(\"Header cannot be null\");\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Method ID 18 (finish)**:\n   - Ensure that the writing process is finalized correctly and that all data is flushed to the output.\n   - Example fix:\n     ```java\n     if (!finished) {\n         throw new IOException(\"Finish method called before completion\");\n     }\n     ```\n\n6. **Method ID 8 (createArchiveEntry)**:\n   - Ensure that the entry is created with valid parameters and handle any potential exceptions.\n   - Example fix:\n     ```java\n     if (inputFile == null) {\n         throw new IOException(\"Input file cannot be null\");\n     }\n     ```\n\n7. **Method ID 34 (getName)**: No changes needed.\n\n8. **Method ID 0 (write)**: No changes needed.\n\n### ReRanked Methods\n\nBased on the analysis and potential fixes, the new ranking of suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
