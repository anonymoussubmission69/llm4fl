"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test failure is caused by an `IOException` indicating an \"Unknown property\" during the execution of the `readFilesInfo` method. This method is responsible for reading file properties and directly relates to the test failure.\n2. The `readHeaders` method is also suspicious as it reads the archive header and checks for signatures and CRCs, which could lead to issues if the header is not formatted correctly.\n3. The `readStreamsInfo` and `readSubStreamsInfo` methods are less directly connected to the error but still play a role in reading information about the streams and sub-streams.\n4. The `writeFilesInfo` method is the least suspicious since it is responsible for writing file information, which is not related to the reading error.\n\n### Potential Fixes\n- **Method `readFilesInfo` (ID: 36)**: \n  - Ensure that all property types are handled correctly. Add checks for unexpected property types and provide meaningful error messages. \n  - Example fix:\n    ```java\n    if (propertyType < 0 || propertyType > MAX_PROPERTY_TYPE) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Unknown property type: \" + propertyType);\n    }\n    ```\n\n- **Method `readHeaders` (ID: 46)**: \n  - Validate the signature and handle cases where the signature does not match expected values. \n  - Example fix:\n    ```java\n    if (!Arrays.equals(signature, sevenZSignature)) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Invalid archive signature.\");\n    }\n    ```\n\n- **Method `readStreamsInfo` (ID: 35)**: \n  - Ensure that the reading of stream information is robust and handles unexpected NID values gracefully.\n  - Example fix:\n    ```java\n    if (nid != expectedNID) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Unexpected NID: \" + nid);\n    }\n    ```\n\n- **Method `readSubStreamsInfo` (ID: 33)**: \n  - Similar to `readStreamsInfo`, ensure that the reading of sub-stream information is robust and handles unexpected NID values.\n  - Example fix:\n    ```java\n    if (nid != expectedNID) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Unexpected NID in sub-streams: \" + nid);\n    }\n    ```\n\n- **Method `writeFilesInfo` (ID: 22)**: \n  - No changes needed as it is not related to the reading error.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods\nBased on the analysis and potential fixes, the new ranking of suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 33,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
