"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test failure is due to an `IOException` indicating an \"Unknown property.\" This error is thrown in the `readFilesInfo` method when an unexpected property type is encountered. \n\n### Method Analysis:\n1. **Method ID 36 (`readFilesInfo`)**: This method directly handles reading file properties and throws an `IOException` for unknown properties. This aligns with the test failure, making it the most suspicious method.\n2. **Method ID 35 (`readStreamsInfo`)**: This method is involved in reading stream information, which is part of the process leading to reading file information. It is somewhat suspicious but does not directly handle unknown properties.\n3. **Method ID 46 (`readHeaders`)**: This method reads headers but does not directly relate to the unknown property issue causing the test failure. It is less suspicious than the previous two.\n4. **Method ID 22 (`writeFilesInfo`)**: This method writes file information and is less likely to be the source of the problem since the test is failing during reading.\n\n### Proposed Fixes:\n- **Method ID 36 (`readFilesInfo`)**: \n  - Ensure that all expected property types are handled correctly. Add logging to capture unexpected property types before throwing the exception. This will help in debugging and understanding what property types are being encountered.\n  \n- **Method ID 35 (`readStreamsInfo`)**: \n  - Review the logic for reading stream information to ensure it correctly aligns with the expected input format. Add validation checks for the stream data being read.\n\n- **Method ID 46 (`readHeaders`)**: \n  - Ensure that the header reading logic is robust and can handle unexpected formats. Consider adding error handling for unexpected header types.\n\n- **Method ID 22 (`writeFilesInfo`)**: \n  - Although this method is less likely to be the source of the problem, ensure that it correctly writes all necessary information and adheres to the expected format.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\nBased on the analysis and potential fixes, the re-ranked list of methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
