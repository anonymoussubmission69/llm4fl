"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test failure is caused by an `IllegalStateException` thrown by the `getCurrentStream()` method when there are no current entries. This indicates that the method `getNextEntry()` may not be setting the current entry correctly, leading to the failure in `getCurrentStream()`.\n\n2. The methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the failure. The most suspicious method is `getCurrentStream()` since it directly throws the exception. The next suspicious method is `getNextEntry()` as it is responsible for advancing to the next entry, which is crucial for the state of the current entry.\n\n3. The other methods, while involved in the process, do not directly manage the state of the current entry and are therefore less suspicious.\n\n### ReRanked Methods and Potential Fixes\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 41,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 25,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Potential Fixes\n\n1. **Method `getCurrentStream()`**:\n   - Ensure that `getNextEntry()` is called before `getCurrentStream()` to avoid the `IllegalStateException`. You might want to add a check or a more informative error message if `getNextEntry()` has not been called.\n\n2. **Method `getNextEntry()`**:\n   - Verify that `currentEntryIndex` is being incremented correctly and that it does not exceed the bounds of the `archive.files` array. If it does, ensure that it resets or handles the state appropriately.\n\n3. **Method `read()`**:\n   - Since `read()` calls `getCurrentStream()`, ensure that it checks if `getNextEntry()` has been called before attempting to read from the stream.\n\n4. **Method `buildDecodingStream()`**:\n   - Ensure that the logic for setting up the decoding stream is robust and handles cases where the current entry might not be valid.\n\n5. **Methods `readPackInfo()`, `readUnpackInfo()`, `readStreamsInfo()`, and `readFilesInfo()`**:\n   - These methods should be reviewed to ensure they correctly populate the state of the archive and its entries, but they are less likely to be the direct cause of the current issue. \n\nBy implementing these fixes, the likelihood of encountering the `IllegalStateException` should be reduced, and the methods should function as intended."
