"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testRoundTripNames` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` when comparing expected and actual results. The failure indicates that there is an issue with how names are being processed, particularly with special characters (like `\u00b1` and `\uffb1`).\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test that need to be analyzed are:\n\n1. **`parseName(byte[] buffer, final int offset, final int length)`**: This method is responsible for parsing a name from a byte array. The way it handles special characters and the termination of the string (with a null byte) could be a source of the issue.\n\n2. **`formatNameBytes(String name, byte[] buf, final int offset, final int length)`**: This method formats a string into a byte array. If it does not correctly handle special characters or if it improperly fills the buffer, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected output.\n\nBoth methods are crucial in the round-trip conversion of names, and any fault in their implementation could propagate and cause the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
