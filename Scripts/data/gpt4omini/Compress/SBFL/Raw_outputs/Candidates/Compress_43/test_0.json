"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`addRawArchiveEntry`** (method_id: 2): This method is responsible for adding a raw archive entry, which is directly related to the test that failed. If there is an issue with how entries are added, it could lead to incorrect data being written.\n\n2. **`writeDataDescriptor`** (method_id: 50): This method writes the data descriptor for an entry. The test failure indicates that the expected data descriptor values do not match the actual values, suggesting that this method may not be functioning correctly.\n\n3. **`closeCopiedEntry`** (method_id: 1): This method is called after copying an entry. If the entry is not closed properly, it could lead to inconsistencies in the data written.\n\n4. **`copyFromZipInputStream`** (method_id: 3): This method handles the copying of data from a zip input stream. If there are issues in reading or writing data, it could affect the integrity of the zip file.\n\n5. **`getRawInputStream`** (method_id: 0): This method retrieves the raw input stream for a zip archive entry. If the input stream is not correctly retrieved, it could lead to incorrect data being processed.\n\n6. **`writeCentralDirectoryInChunks`** (method_id: 71): This method writes the central directory in chunks. If there are issues in how the central directory is written, it could affect the overall structure of the zip file.\n\n7. **`handleSizesAndCrc`** (method_id: 54): This method handles the sizes and CRC values for entries. If the sizes or CRC values are incorrect, it could lead to data integrity issues.\n\n8. **`validateSizeInformation`** (method_id: 102): This method validates the size information for entries. If the validation fails, it could lead to incorrect data being written.\n\n9. **`setDefaults`** (method_id: 101): This method sets default values for an entry. If defaults are not set correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n10. **`writeLocalFileHeader`** (method_id: 74): This method writes the local file header for an entry. If the header is not written correctly, it could lead to issues when reading the zip file.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 50, 1, 3, 0, 71, 54, 102, 101, 74]\n}\n```"
