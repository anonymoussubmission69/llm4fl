"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `survivesBlankLinesInPaxHeader` is failing due to a `NegativeArraySizeException` that occurs in the `parsePaxHeaders` method of the `TarArchiveInputStream` class. This indicates that there is an issue with the handling of the input stream when parsing Pax headers, likely related to the size of an array being allocated.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the failure propagates through several methods:\n   - `getNextTarEntry` calls `paxHeaders`.\n   - `paxHeaders` calls `parsePaxHeaders`.\n\n3. The methods that are directly involved in the failure are:\n   - `parsePaxHeaders`\n   - `paxHeaders`\n   - `getNextTarEntry`\n\n4. Additionally, the `TarArchiveInputStream` class is responsible for reading and processing the tar entries, which means that methods related to reading and managing the tar entries could also be relevant.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be investigated further:\n\n- `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.tar.TarArchiveInputStream:getNextTarEntry()`\n- `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.tar.TarArchiveInputStream:paxHeaders()`\n- `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.tar.TarArchiveInputStream:parsePaxHeaders(Ljava/io/InputStream;)`\n- `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.tar.TarArchiveInputStream:read([BII)`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [24, 7, 8, 12]\n}\n```"
