"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`reparseCentralDirectoryData`** (method_id: 0)\n   - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is responsible for checking the length of the central directory zip64 extended information extra field. The exception indicates a mismatch in expected length, which suggests that this method may not be handling the data correctly.\n\n2. **`setSizesAndOffsetFromZip64Extra`** (method_id: 19)\n   - This method is called in the context of setting sizes and offsets from the zip64 extra field. It interacts with the `reparseCentralDirectoryData` method, which is already identified as suspicious.\n\n3. **`populateFromCentralDirectory`** (method_id: 26)\n   - This method is responsible for populating data from the central directory. It may be involved in the process that leads to the incorrect length being reported.\n\n4. **`positionAtCentralDirectory64`** (method_id: 1)\n   - This method is related to positioning at the central directory for zip64. It may be involved in the data retrieval process that leads to the exception.\n\n5. **`parseFromCentralDirectoryData`** (method_id: 2)\n   - This method is responsible for parsing data from the central directory. If the data being parsed is incorrect, it could lead to the issues observed in the test.\n\n6. **`parseFromLocalFileData`** (method_id: 5)\n   - This method is responsible for parsing local file data, which may also be relevant if the local data is not aligned with the expected structure.\n\n7. **`readCentralDirectoryEntry`** (method_id: 18)\n   - This method reads entries from the central directory and may be involved in the process that leads to the exception.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 5, 19, 26, 18]\n}\n```"
