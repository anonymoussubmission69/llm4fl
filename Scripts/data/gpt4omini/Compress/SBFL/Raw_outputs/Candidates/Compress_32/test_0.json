"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **applyPaxHeadersToCurrentEntry**: This method is responsible for applying the PAX headers to the current entry. The stack trace indicates that a `NumberFormatException` occurs when trying to parse the group ID, which is likely being set in this method.\n\n2. **addPaxHeaderForBigNumber**: This method is called to add headers for big numbers. It checks if the value is within a valid range and adds it to the headers. If the value exceeds the maximum allowed, it could lead to issues.\n\n3. **setGroupId**: This method sets the group ID for a `TarArchiveEntry`. The test attempts to set a large group ID (4294967294), which may not be handled correctly if the underlying implementation expects a smaller value.\n\n4. **getLongGroupId**: This method retrieves the long group ID. If the group ID was set incorrectly or if there is an issue in the conversion, it could lead to the `NumberFormatException`.\n\n5. **parsePaxHeaders**: This method is responsible for parsing the PAX headers from the input stream. If the headers are not parsed correctly, it could lead to incorrect values being set.\n\n6. **getNextTarEntry**: This method retrieves the next tar entry and applies the PAX headers. If there is an issue in the retrieval or application of headers, it could lead to the observed exception.\n\n7. **TarArchiveOutputStream**: The constructor and methods related to this class are also relevant since they are responsible for writing the tar entries and managing the output stream.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [8, 1, 2, 33, 11, 70, 46]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes methods that are directly involved in setting or retrieving the group ID, as well as those that handle PAX headers, which are critical to the functionality being tested."
