"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testCpioUnarchiveCreatedByRedlineRpm` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` indicating \"Unknown mode.\" This exception is thrown from the `setMode` method of the `CpioArchiveEntry` class.\n2. The stack trace shows that the failure occurs during the execution of the `getNextEntry` method, which calls `setMode` after reading a mode value.\n3. The `getNextEntry` method is invoked from the `CpioArchiveInputStream` class, which is responsible for reading entries from the CPIO archive.\n4. The `readNewEntry` method is also involved in the process of reading a new entry and setting various attributes, including the mode.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. `setMode(long mode)` - This method is directly responsible for throwing the exception when an unknown mode is encountered.\n2. `getNextEntry()` - This method is responsible for retrieving the next entry and calls `setMode`.\n3. `readNewEntry(boolean hasCrc)` - This method reads the new entry and sets the mode, which is where the mode value is initially read.\n4. `getNextCPIOEntry()` - This method orchestrates the reading of the next CPIO entry and calls `getNextEntry`.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [18, 2, 9, 14]\n}\n```"
