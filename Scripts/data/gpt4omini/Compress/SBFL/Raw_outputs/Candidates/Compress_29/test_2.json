"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testEncodingInputStreamAutodetect` failed due to an assertion error indicating that 24 tests failed. The test appears to be checking the encoding of various input streams against expected values. The failure suggests that there may be an issue with how the encoding is being determined or set within the input streams.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include constructors and methods related to various archive input streams, such as `CpioArchiveInputStream`, `TarArchiveInputStream`, and `ArjArchiveInputStream`. These methods are responsible for initializing the input streams and potentially setting the encoding.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **CpioArchiveInputStream Constructor**: \n   - `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.cpio.CpioArchiveInputStream:<init>(Ljava/io/InputStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V`\n   - This method initializes the CpioArchiveInputStream with an input stream and encoding. If the encoding is not set correctly, it could lead to failures in encoding detection.\n\n2. **ArchiveStreamFactory:setEntryEncoding**: \n   - `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.ArchiveStreamFactory:setEntryEncoding(Ljava/lang/String;)V`\n   - This method sets the entry encoding. If the encoding is not set properly, it could affect how the input streams interpret the data.\n\n3. **TarArchiveInputStream Constructor**: \n   - `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.tar.TarArchiveInputStream:<init>(Ljava/io/InputStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V`\n   - Similar to the CpioArchiveInputStream, this constructor initializes the TarArchiveInputStream with an input stream and encoding.\n\n4. **ArjArchiveInputStream Constructor**: \n   - `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.arj.ArjArchiveInputStream:<init>(Ljava/io/InputStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V`\n   - This constructor initializes the ArjArchiveInputStream and may also be affected by encoding issues.\n\n5. **ZipArchiveInputStream Constructor**: \n   - `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipArchiveInputStream:<init>(Ljava/io/InputStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V`\n   - This constructor initializes the ZipArchiveInputStream and could also be a source of encoding-related issues.\n\n6. **DumpArchiveInputStream Constructor**: \n   - `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.dump.DumpArchiveInputStream:<init>(Ljava/io/InputStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V`\n   - This constructor initializes the DumpArchiveInputStream and may also be involved in encoding detection.\n\n7. **ArchiveInputStream:pushedBackBytes**: \n   - `org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.ArchiveInputStream:pushedBackBytes(J)V`\n   - This method manages the bytes read and could potentially affect how the input stream processes data.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 57]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the encoding detection process and may be contributing to the test failures. Further investigation into their implementations and interactions is warranted to identify the root cause of the failures."
