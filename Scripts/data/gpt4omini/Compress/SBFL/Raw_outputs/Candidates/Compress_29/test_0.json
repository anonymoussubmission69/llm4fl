"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testEncodingInputStream` failed due to a mismatch between the expected encoding and the actual encoding retrieved from the `ArchiveInputStream`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred after 20 tests, suggesting that there may be multiple methods involved in the encoding process.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **CpioArchiveInputStream Constructor**: This method initializes the `CpioArchiveInputStream` with an input stream and encoding. If the encoding is incorrect, it could lead to failures in encoding tests.\n   - Method ID: 0\n\n2. **JarArchiveInputStream Constructor**: Similar to the above, this method initializes the `JarArchiveInputStream` and could also be a source of encoding issues.\n   - Method ID: 1\n\n3. **SetEntryEncoding**: This method sets the entry encoding for the archive. If the encoding is not set correctly, it could lead to mismatches in expected and actual encoding.\n   - Method ID: 2\n\n4. **TarArchiveInputStream Constructor**: This method initializes the `TarArchiveInputStream` and could also be a source of encoding issues.\n   - Method ID: 3\n\n5. **ArjArchiveInputStream Constructor**: This method initializes the `ArjArchiveInputStream` and could also be a source of encoding issues.\n   - Method ID: 4\n\n6. **DumpArchiveInputStream Constructor**: This method initializes the `DumpArchiveInputStream` and could also be a source of encoding issues.\n   - Method ID: 46\n\n7. **ZipArchiveInputStream Constructor**: This method initializes the `ZipArchiveInputStream` and could also be a source of encoding issues.\n   - Method ID: 59\n\n8. **ArchiveStreamFactory Create Method**: This method creates an archive input stream based on the archiver name and encoding. If the encoding is not handled properly, it could lead to failures in encoding tests.\n   - Method ID: 87\n\nThese methods are critical in the encoding process and should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failures.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 46, 59, 87]\n}\n```"
