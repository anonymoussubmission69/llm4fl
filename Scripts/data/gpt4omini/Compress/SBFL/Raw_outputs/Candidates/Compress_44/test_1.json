"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testClassInstantiationWithParameterBeingNullThrowsNullPointerExceptionTwo` is designed to check if a `NullPointerException` is thrown when a `null` value is passed to the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`. The stack trace indicates that the test failed because the expected exception was not thrown.\n\nThe only method covered by the failed test is the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`, which is defined as follows:\n\n```java\npublic ChecksumCalculatingInputStream(final Checksum checksum, final InputStream in) {\n    this.checksum = checksum;\n    this.in = in;\n}\n```\n\nIn this constructor, if `checksum` or `in` is `null`, it is likely that a `NullPointerException` would be thrown when trying to use these fields later in the class. Since the test is specifically checking for a `NullPointerException` when `null` is passed as the first parameter, this constructor is the primary suspect.\n\nThus, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
