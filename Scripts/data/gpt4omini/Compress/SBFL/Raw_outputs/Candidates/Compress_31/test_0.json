"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testParseOctalInvalid` is designed to validate the behavior of the `TarUtils.parseOctal` method when provided with invalid input. The test expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown under various conditions, such as when the input byte array is too short or contains invalid characters.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the test failed specifically when the input contained an embedded NUL character, which suggests that the `parseOctal` method is not handling this case correctly.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`TarUtils.parseOctal([BII)J`**: This method is directly responsible for parsing the octal value from the byte array. The test is specifically designed to validate its behavior with invalid inputs, making it the primary suspect for the failure.\n\n2. **`TarUtils.exceptionMessage([BIIIB)Ljava/lang/String;`**: This method is used to generate an exception message when an error occurs in the `parseOctal` method. If the exception message generation is not correctly handling certain inputs, it could contribute to the failure.\n\nThe other methods listed do not seem to be directly related to the parsing logic or the handling of invalid inputs, so they are less likely to be the source of the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
