"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `aiffFilesAreNoTARs` is failing because it is trying to create an archive input stream from a non-archive file (AIFF file). The failure occurs at the line where the `createArchiveInputStream` method is called, which indicates that the methods involved in the archive creation and matching process are likely to be suspicious.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.ArchiveStreamFactory:createArchiveInputStream`** - This method is responsible for creating an archive input stream and is directly involved in the failure.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.tar.TarArchiveInputStream:matches`** - This method checks if the input matches the TAR format, which is relevant since the test is checking for non-TAR files.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.dump.DumpArchiveInputStream:matches`** - Similar to the TAR check, this method checks for a different archive format.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipArchiveInputStream:matches`** - This method checks for ZIP format, which is also relevant in the context of archive creation.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.cpio.CpioArchiveInputStream:matches`** - This method checks for CPIO format, adding to the context of archive matching.\n\nThese methods are interconnected in the process of determining whether the input stream corresponds to a valid archive format. Analyzing these methods will help identify the root cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [34, 1, 2, 35, 5]\n}\n```"
