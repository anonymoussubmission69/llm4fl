"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSevenEmptyFiles` calls the method `testCompress252(7, 0)`, which is likely responsible for the failure.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IOException` occurred due to an \"Unknown property\" while reading files info in the `SevenZFile` class.\n3. The failure seems to propagate from the `readFilesInfo` method in the `SevenZFile` class, which is responsible for reading the properties of the files.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`SevenZFile:readFilesInfo` (method_id: 36)**: This method is directly involved in reading file properties and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`SevenZFile:readHeader` (method_id: 35)**: This method is called before `readFilesInfo` and may be responsible for setting up the context for reading file properties.\n- **`SevenZFile:readHeaders` (method_id: 46)**: This method is responsible for reading the headers of the archive, which may include critical information for the subsequent reading of file properties.\n- **`SevenZOutputFile:writeFilesInfo` (method_id: 22)**: This method is responsible for writing file information to the archive and may have implications on how files are read later.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [22, 35, 36, 46]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
