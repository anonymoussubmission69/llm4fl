"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testEightEmptyFiles` calls the method `testCompress252(8, 0)`, which is likely responsible for compressing files.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IOException` occurred due to an \"Unknown property\" at line 192, which suggests that the method `readFilesInfo` in the `SevenZFile` class is trying to read a property that it does not recognize.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `SevenZFile.readFilesInfo`\n   - `SevenZFile.readHeaders`\n   - `SevenZFile.readFilesInfo`\n   - `SevenZOutputFileTest.verifyCompress252`\n   - `SevenZOutputFileTest.testCompress252`\n   - `SevenZOutputFileTest.testEightEmptyFiles`\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`SevenZFile.readFilesInfo` (method_id: 36)**: This method is directly involved in reading file information and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`SevenZFile.readHeaders` (method_id: 46)**: This method is responsible for reading the headers, which may include properties that are expected to be present.\n- **`SevenZOutputFile.writeFilesInfo` (method_id: 22)**: This method writes file information and may be related to how the properties are structured.\n- **`SevenZOutputFile.writeFileEmptyFiles` (method_id: 24)**: This method handles empty files, which could be relevant if the test is dealing with empty files.\n- **`SevenZOutputFile.writeFileAntiItems` (method_id: 25)**: This method deals with anti-items, which may also be relevant to the properties being read.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [22, 24, 25, 36, 46]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
