"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testNineFilesSomeNotEmpty` is failing due to an `IOException` with the message \"Unknown property 128\". This indicates that there is an issue with reading properties from a file, likely related to the `SevenZFile` class.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the error originates from the `readFilesInfo` method in the `SevenZFile` class, which is responsible for reading file information from the archive. This method is called during the initialization of the `SevenZFile` object.\n\n3. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods in the `SevenZOutputFile` and `SevenZFile` classes, which are involved in writing and reading the archive files.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `SevenZFile:readFilesInfo` (method_id: 36) - This method is directly involved in reading file properties and is where the exception is thrown.\n- `SevenZFile:readHeaders` (method_id: 46) - This method is responsible for reading the headers of the archive, which may include the properties that are causing the issue.\n- `SevenZFile:readStreamsInfo` (method_id: 35) - This method reads stream information, which could also be related to the properties being read.\n- `SevenZFile:readSubStreamsInfo` (method_id: 33) - This method reads sub-stream information and may be relevant to the properties being processed.\n- `SevenZOutputFile:writeFilesInfo` (method_id: 22) - This method writes file information to the archive and may have implications on how properties are stored.\n\nBased on the analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [36, 46, 35, 33, 22]\n}\n```"
