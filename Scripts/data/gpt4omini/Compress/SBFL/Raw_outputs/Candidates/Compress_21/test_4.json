"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSixEmptyFiles` calls the method `testCompress252`, which is where the failure occurs.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure is due to a `java.io.IOException: Badly terminated header`, which occurs in the `readHeader` method of the `SevenZFile` class.\n3. The `readHeader` method is called during the initialization of the `SevenZFile` object, which is likely triggered by the `testCompress252` method.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`SevenZFile:readHeader` (method_id: 35)**: This method is directly implicated in the exception thrown.\n- **`SevenZFile:readHeaders` (method_id: 47)**: This method is responsible for reading the headers and may be related to the issue.\n- **`SevenZFile:readStreamsInfo` (method_id: 36)**: This method is called within `readHeader` and may contribute to the problem.\n- **`SevenZFile:readFilesInfo` (method_id: 37)**: This method is also called within `readHeader` and may be relevant to the header termination issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [35, 36, 37, 47]\n}\n```"
