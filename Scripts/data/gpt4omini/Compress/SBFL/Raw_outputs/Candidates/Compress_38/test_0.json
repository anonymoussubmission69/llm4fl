"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `survivesPaxHeaderWithNameEndingInSlash` is failing due to an `IOException` that occurs while parsing the header in the `TarArchiveInputStream` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the error originates from the `getNextTarEntry` method, which calls `paxHeaders`, and the issue seems to be related to the parsing of the PAX headers.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`getNextTarEntry()`**: This method is directly involved in retrieving the next entry and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`paxHeaders()`**: This method is called within `getNextTarEntry()` and is responsible for processing PAX headers.\n- **`parsePaxHeaders(InputStream)`**: This method is called within `paxHeaders()` and is responsible for parsing the PAX headers from the input stream.\n- **`getRecord()`**: This method is called within `getNextTarEntry()` and retrieves the record that is likely being parsed.\n- **`isEOFRecord(byte[])`**: This method checks if the record is an EOF record, which could affect the reading of the next entry.\n- **`readRecord()`**: This method reads the record from the input stream and could be related to the issue if it does not read correctly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and the fault may propagate through them. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [28, 8, 9, 29, 30, 31]\n}\n```"
