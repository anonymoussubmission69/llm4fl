"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `bigEndianWithOverflow` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected value `8274274654740644818` with the actual value `203824122492715986`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the method that reads bits from the input stream, specifically in how bits are being processed or cached.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`BitInputStream` constructor** (`<init>`): This method initializes the `BitInputStream` object and sets up the input stream and byte order. If there is an issue with how the input stream is initialized or how the byte order is set, it could lead to incorrect bit reading.\n\n2. **`BitInputStream:readBits(I)J`**: This method is responsible for reading bits from the input stream. Given that the test is failing during a call to `readBits`, this method is highly suspicious. The logic for reading bits, especially the handling of the cached bits and the byte order, should be closely examined.\n\n3. **Static initializer** (`<clinit>`): This method initializes static variables, including the `MASKS` array used in the `readBits` method. If there is an issue with the initialization of these masks, it could affect the bit reading logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be investigated further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
