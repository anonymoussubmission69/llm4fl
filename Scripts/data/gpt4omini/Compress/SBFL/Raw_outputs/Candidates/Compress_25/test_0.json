"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testReadingOfFirstStoredEntry` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing two byte arrays. The expected size of the ZipArchiveEntry is 5, but the actual size returned is 0. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the method that reads the stored entry data.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the method `assertArrayEquals` in the test, which suggests that the problem lies in the data being read from the `ZipArchiveInputStream`.\n\n3. The covered methods by the failed test include `readStored`, which is responsible for reading the stored data from the zip entry. This method is a strong candidate for investigation as it directly relates to the failure.\n\n4. Other methods that are involved in the process of reading and handling zip entries, such as `getNextZipEntry`, `read`, and methods related to data descriptors, should also be considered as they may contribute to the issue.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n- `readStored(byte[] buffer, int offset, int length)` - This method is directly responsible for reading the stored data.\n- `read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int length)` - This method calls `readStored` and handles the reading process.\n- `getNextZipEntry()` - This method retrieves the next zip entry and may affect how data is read.\n- `supportsDataDescriptorFor(ZipArchiveEntry entry)` - This method checks if the entry supports data descriptors, which could influence how data is read.\n- `readFully(byte[] b)` - This method is used to read data into a byte array and may affect the data being read.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 47, 86, 44, 90]\n}\n```"
