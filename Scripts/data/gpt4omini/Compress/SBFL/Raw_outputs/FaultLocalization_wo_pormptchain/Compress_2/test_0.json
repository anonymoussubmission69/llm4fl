"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getNextEntry()' calls 'getNextArEntry()' which is responsible for reading the next entry in the archive.
