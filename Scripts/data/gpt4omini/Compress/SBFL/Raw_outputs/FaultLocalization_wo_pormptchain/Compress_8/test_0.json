The test case expects an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown when the byte array is empty, but the method does not handle this case properly. It immediately returns 'result' without checking the length of the input, which leads to the failure of the test. This indicates that the method is likely the source of the fault.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
