"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'readFilesInfo' is responsible for reading file information from the input stream.

This could happen if the number of files read is incorrect or if the input data is malformed.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'readStreamsInfo' is responsible for reading stream information from the input.
