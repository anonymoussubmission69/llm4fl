"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'readFilesInfo' is responsible for reading file information from the input stream. The stack trace indicates an IOException with the message 'Unknown property', which suggests that this method may not be correctly handling the properties of the files being read, leading to the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'readStreamsInfo' is called before 'readFilesInfo' and is responsible for reading stream information. If it fails to read the correct stream information, it could lead to issues in 'readFilesInfo', making it suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getName' retrieves the name of the archive entry. If the name is not set correctly or is null, it could lead to issues when reading file properties, contributing to the IOException.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFilesInfo' is responsible for writing file information to the output stream. If there are inconsistencies in the data being written, it could lead to issues when reading back the data, making it a potential source of the problem.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeHeader' is responsible for writing the header information. If the header is not written correctly, it could lead to issues when reading the file, making it a less likely but still possible source of the problem.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
