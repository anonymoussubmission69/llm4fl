The test failure indicates that the expected number of bytes skipped was 10, but only 5 were actually skipped. This discrepancy suggests that there may be a logical error in how the method calculates the number of bytes to skip, particularly in the loop where it checks if 'skipped' is 0 and breaks out of the loop prematurely. This makes it the most suspicious method.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
