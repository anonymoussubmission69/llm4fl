"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testSevenEmptyFiles` is failing due to an `IOException` with the message \"Unknown property 128\". This indicates that the code is trying to read a property from the input stream that it does not recognize, which suggests that there may be an issue with how properties are being read or handled in the methods related to reading file information.\n\nNow, let's analyze the method bodies for the provided method IDs:\n\n1. **Method ID 36 (`readFilesInfo`)**: This method is responsible for reading file information from the input stream. It includes logic to handle various property types and has a specific case for throwing an `IOException` when an unknown property is encountered. Given that the test is failing due to an unknown property, this method is highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Method ID 35 (`readStreamsInfo`)**: This method reads stream information and calls other methods to read pack and unpack information. While it does not directly throw an exception related to unknown properties, it is part of the process that leads to reading file information. It is somewhat suspicious but less so than `readFilesInfo`.\n\n3. **Method ID 22 (`writeFilesInfo`)**: This method is responsible for writing file information to the output stream. Since the test is failing during reading, this method is less likely to be the source of the problem, making it the least suspicious.\n\n4. **Method ID 46 (`readHeaders`)**: This method reads the headers of the archive. While it is crucial for the overall functionality, it does not directly relate to the unknown property issue that is causing the test to fail. Therefore, it is also less suspicious.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method reads file information and directly handles property types, including throwing an IOException for unknown properties. This aligns with the test failure due to an unknown property.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method reads stream information and is part of the process that leads to reading file information. It is somewhat suspicious but does not directly handle unknown properties.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method reads headers and is important for the overall functionality, but it does not directly relate to the unknown property issue causing the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method writes file information and is less likely to be the source of the problem since the test is failing during reading.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
