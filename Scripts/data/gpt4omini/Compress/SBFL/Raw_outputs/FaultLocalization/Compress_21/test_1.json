"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the error `java.io.IOException: Unknown property 128` indicates that the method responsible for reading properties from a data input stream is encountering an unexpected property type. This suggests that the methods involved in reading the file information and streams are likely to be the most suspicious.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'readFilesInfo' is responsible for reading file information from a data input stream. It includes logic to handle various property types, and the error indicates that it encountered an unknown property type (128). This suggests that there may be a flaw in how properties are read or validated.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 35,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'readStreamsInfo' reads stream information and calls other methods to read pack and unpack info. If the stream information is not read correctly, it could lead to issues in subsequent processing, including the unknown property error.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFilesInfo' writes file information to a data output stream. If the properties being written do not match the expected format or values, it could lead to inconsistencies when reading them back, potentially causing the unknown property error.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeHeader' writes the header information, which includes streams and files info. If the header is not constructed correctly, it could lead to issues when reading the header, contributing to the unknown property error.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 18,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'finish' finalizes the writing process and includes writing the header. While it is less directly related to the reading of properties, any issues in finalization could affect the integrity of the data being read.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'createArchiveEntry' creates a new archive entry. While it is not directly related to reading properties, if the entries are not created correctly, it could lead to issues later in processing.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 34,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getName' simply returns the name of an entry. It is unlikely to be the source of the error since it does not involve any reading or writing of properties.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'write' is a basic write operation. It is the least suspicious as it does not involve any complex logic or property handling.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    }\n]\n```"
