"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the failure is related to a `ZipException` indicating that the central directory zip64 extended information extra field's length does not match the expected length. This suggests that the methods involved in parsing and handling the zip file's central directory and its associated extra fields are likely to be the source of the issue.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method reparseCentralDirectoryData checks the length of rawCentralDirectoryData against an expected length. If the lengths do not match, it throws a ZipException. This is directly related to the error message in the stack trace, making it highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method setSizesAndOffsetFromZip64Extra is responsible for setting sizes and offsets based on Zip64 extra fields. It checks for the presence of uncompressed and compressed sizes, which are critical for the integrity of the zip file structure. Any issues here could lead to mismatches in expected lengths.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method positionAtCentralDirectory64 is involved in positioning the archive at the central directory for Zip64. If it incorrectly calculates the position or fails to read the expected data, it could lead to issues in subsequent parsing.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method parseFromCentralDirectoryData copies data from a buffer into rawCentralDirectoryData. If the length is not handled correctly, it could lead to incorrect data being processed, contributing to the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method parseFromLocalFileData processes local file data.
