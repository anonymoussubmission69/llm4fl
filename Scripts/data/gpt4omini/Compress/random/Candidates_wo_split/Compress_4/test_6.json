The stack trace does not provide specific error messages, but it indicates that the test is failing during the execution of methods related to the `ZipArchiveOutputStream` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ZipArchiveOutputStream` class, which are responsible for writing and managing zip entries. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:putArchiveEntry`** - This method is responsible for adding a new archive entry. If there is an issue with how entries are being added, it could lead to failures in the roundtrip process.\n2. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:closeArchiveEntry`** - This method finalizes the current entry. If there are issues with closing entries properly, it could affect the integrity of the zip file.\n3. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:write`** - This method writes data to the current entry. If there are problems with how data is written, it could lead to corrupted entries.\n4. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:finish`** - This method finalizes the output stream. If it does not handle the finalization correctly, it could lead to incomplete or corrupted zip files.\n5. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:deflate`** - This method handles the compression of data. If there are issues with the compression process, it could lead to data loss or corruption.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, leading to the failure of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 3, 70, 2, 6]\n}\n```"
