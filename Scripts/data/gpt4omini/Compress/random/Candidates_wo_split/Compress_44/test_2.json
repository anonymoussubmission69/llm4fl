The constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` is the only method covered by the failed test, which is suspicious because it directly relates to the test's purpose.\n\nHere is the summary of the findings:\n\n1. The test attempts to create an instance of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` with `null` values for its parameters.\n2. The constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` does not handle `null` values, which could lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n\nThus, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
