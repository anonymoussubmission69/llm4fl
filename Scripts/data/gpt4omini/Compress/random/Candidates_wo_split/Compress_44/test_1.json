This is expected to throw a `NullPointerException`, indicating that the constructor does not handle `null` values properly.\n\nThe covered method identified is the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`, which is suspicious because it directly relates to the test case that is failing. The constructor does not seem to have any null checks for its parameters, which could lead to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n``` \n\nThis indicates that the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` is the primary method to analyze for potential faults related to the test failure."
