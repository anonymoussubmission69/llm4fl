The constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` takes two parameters: a `Checksum` object and an `InputStream`. \n\nThe covered method identified is the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`, which is likely the source of the fault since it is being tested for handling a `null` parameter. \n\nGiven that the test is specifically checking for a `NullPointerException`, the constructor is the primary suspect. There are no other methods covered by the failed test, so we will focus on the constructor.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The constructor of ChecksumCalculatingInputStream is suspicious due to null parameter handling.\n}\n```"
