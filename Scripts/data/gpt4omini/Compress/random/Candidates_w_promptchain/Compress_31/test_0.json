    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testParseOctalInvalid` is designed to validate the behavior of the `TarUtils.parseOctal` method when provided with various invalid inputs. The test expects an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown under specific conditions, such as when the input byte array is too short or contains invalid characters.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **TarUtils.parseOctal**: This method is directly invoked in the test and is the primary suspect since the test is designed to validate its behavior with invalid inputs.\n2. **TarUtils.exceptionMessage**: This method is likely used within `parseOctal` to generate exception messages, and any issues in how exceptions are handled or reported could also be relevant.\n3. **ZipEncodingHelper methods**: While not directly invoked in the test, methods related to encoding may be indirectly involved if the input byte arrays are being processed or interpreted in a way that relies on encoding.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `TarUtils:parseOctal([BII)J` (method_id: 7)\n- `TarUtils:exceptionMessage([BIIIB)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 8)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [7, 8]\n}\n```"
