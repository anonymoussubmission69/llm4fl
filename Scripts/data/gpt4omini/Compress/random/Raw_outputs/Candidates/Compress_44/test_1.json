"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testClassInstantiationWithParameterBeingNullThrowsNullPointerExceptionTwo` is attempting to instantiate the `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` class with a `null` parameter for the `Checksum` object. This is expected to throw a `NullPointerException`.\n\nThe covered method from the failed test is the constructor of the `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` class, which takes a `Checksum` and an `InputStream` as parameters. The constructor assigns these parameters to instance variables without any null checks, which is likely the source of the fault.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **Constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`**: This method is directly involved in the test and is where the null parameter is being passed, leading to the `NullPointerException`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only suspicious method identified is the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`, as it is directly related to the failure observed in the test.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The potential suspicious method's ids\n}\n```"
