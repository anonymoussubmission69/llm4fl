"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is designed to check if a `NullPointerException` is thrown when instantiating the `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` class with `null` parameters. The constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` is the only method covered by the failed test, which is directly related to the test case.\n\nThe suspicious method identified is:\n\n1. **ChecksumCalculatingInputStream constructor**: This method is responsible for initializing the object with the provided parameters. Since the test is specifically checking for a `NullPointerException` when `null` values are passed, this method is likely where the fault lies.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
