"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCompress197` is attempting to read entries from a tar archive using the `TarArchiveInputStream` class. The test fails when it encounters an `IOException`, which is caught and reported. \n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include various methods related to tar and zip encoding, particularly those in the `TarArchiveInputStream` and `TarBuffer` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious as they are directly involved in reading the tar entries and handling the input stream:\n\n1. **`TarArchiveInputStream:getNextTarEntry()`** - This method is responsible for retrieving the next tar entry and is likely where the failure occurs if the tar structure is invalid or if there is an issue with the input stream.\n2. **`TarArchiveInputStream:getRecord()`** - This method reads a record from the tar buffer and could be a point of failure if the record is malformed or if the end of the file is reached unexpectedly.\n3. **`TarBuffer:readRecord()`** - This method reads a record from the input stream and could also be a source of the IOException if there are issues with the stream.\n4. **`TarBuffer:readBlock()`** - This method reads a block of data from the input stream and could fail if the input stream is not functioning correctly.\n5. **`TarBuffer:isEOFRecord(byte[])`** - This method checks if the record read is an EOF record, which could lead to issues if the logic for determining EOF is incorrect.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [26, 27, 10, 11, 9]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
