"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testCP437FileRoundtripExplicitUnicodeExtra` is likely testing the functionality of the `ZipArchiveOutputStream` class, particularly focusing on handling files with specific encodings (CP437 in this case). The test calls the method `testFileRoundtrip` with parameters that suggest it is checking for proper encoding and decoding of files.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ZipArchiveOutputStream` class, which are responsible for writing and managing zip entries. The following methods are particularly suspicious as they are involved in writing data, handling entries, and managing encoding:\n\n1. **`putArchiveEntry(ArchiveEntry archiveEntry)`** - This method is responsible for adding an entry to the archive, which is crucial for the roundtrip functionality.\n2. **`closeArchiveEntry()`** - This method finalizes the current entry, which is important for ensuring that the data is written correctly.\n3. **`writeLocalFileHeader(ZipArchiveEntry ze)`** - This method writes the local file header, which is essential for the integrity of the zip file.\n4. **`writeCentralFileHeader(ZipArchiveEntry ze)`** - This method writes the central file header, which is also critical for the zip file structure.\n5. **`writeOut(byte[] data)`** - This method handles the actual writing of data to the output stream, which is fundamental to the roundtrip process.\n6. **`deflate()`** - This method is responsible for compressing the data, which could affect how the data is stored and retrieved.\n7. **`setEncoding(String encoding)`** - This method sets the encoding for the zip file, which is directly related to the test's focus on CP437 encoding.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could lead to the failure of the test. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 3, 8, 7, 10, 70, 67]\n}\n```"
