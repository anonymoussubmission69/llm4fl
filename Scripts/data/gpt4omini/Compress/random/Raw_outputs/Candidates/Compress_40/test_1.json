"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test method `littleEndianWithOverflow` is designed to test the `BitInputStream` class, specifically its ability to read bits in little-endian order. The test includes assertions that check the output of the `readBits` method for various bit counts.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **Constructor of `BitInputStream`**: This method initializes the input stream and sets up the necessary variables. If there is an issue with how the stream is initialized or how the byte order is set, it could lead to failures in reading bits.\n\n2. **Static initializer of `BitInputStream`**: This method sets up static constants used for bit manipulation. If there is a problem with the initialization of these constants, it could affect the behavior of the `readBits` method.\n\n3. **`readBits(int count)` method**: This method is crucial as it directly handles the reading of bits from the input stream. The logic within this method is complex, especially with the handling of the bit cache and the byte order. Any issues here could lead to incorrect results, which is likely the cause of the test failure.\n\nGiven the context, the most suspicious methods that need further analysis are the `readBits` method and the constructor of `BitInputStream`, as they are directly involved in the functionality being tested.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
