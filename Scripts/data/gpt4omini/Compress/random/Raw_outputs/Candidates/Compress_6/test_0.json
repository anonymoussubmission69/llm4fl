"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNotEquals()` is designed to check that two `ZipArchiveEntry` objects with different names are not considered equal. The test fails at the assertion `assertFalse(entry1.equals(entry2));`, indicating that the `equals` method is likely not functioning as expected.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `ZipArchiveEntry` constructor that takes a `String` (method_id: 0)\n2. `ZipArchiveEntry` constructor that takes a `ZipEntry` (method_id: 1)\n3. `equals` method of `ZipArchiveEntry` (method_id: 2)\n\nThe most suspicious method here is the `equals` method (method_id: 2) since it directly relates to the failure of the test. The constructors (method_id: 0 and method_id: 1) are also relevant because they initialize the `ZipArchiveEntry` objects, and any issues in the initialization could affect the equality check.\n\nThus, the potential suspicious methods that need further analysis are:\n- `equals` method (method_id: 2)\n- Constructors (method_id: 0 and method_id: 1)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
