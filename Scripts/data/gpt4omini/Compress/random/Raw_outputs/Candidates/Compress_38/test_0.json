"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `survivesPaxHeaderWithNameEndingInSlash` is designed to check the behavior of the `TarArchiveInputStream` when processing a tar file. The test specifically checks if the `getNextTarEntry()` method correctly retrieves the next entry and if the entry's name matches the expected value.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the test failed when trying to assert the expected entry name, which suggests that the issue may lie in the methods responsible for reading and parsing the tar entries.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious for further analysis:\n\n1. **`getNextTarEntry()`** - This method is directly involved in retrieving the next entry from the tar archive. Any issues in this method could lead to incorrect entries being returned.\n2. **`isGNULongLinkEntry()`** - This method checks if the current entry is a GNU long link entry, which may affect how entries are processed.\n3. **`isGNULongNameEntry()`** - Similar to the above, this method checks for long name entries, which could also impact the retrieval of the correct entry.\n4. **`isGlobalPaxHeader()`** - This method checks if the current entry is a global Pax header, which is relevant to the test's focus on Pax headers.\n5. **`isPaxHeader()`** - This method checks if the current entry is a Pax header, which is crucial for the test's purpose.\n6. **`paxHeaders()`** - This method processes Pax headers, and any issues here could lead to incorrect handling of entries.\n7. **`getRecord()`** - This method retrieves the record for the current entry, and any issues in reading the record could lead to incorrect entry data.\n8. **`readRecord()`** - This method reads the record from the input stream, and any issues here could affect the data being read.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [44, 25, 24, 26, 49, 46, 48, 47]\n}\n```"
