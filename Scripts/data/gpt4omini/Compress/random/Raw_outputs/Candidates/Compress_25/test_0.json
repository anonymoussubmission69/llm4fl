"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReadingOfFirstStoredEntry` is attempting to read a ZIP archive entry and validate its size and content. The failure likely occurs during the reading of the ZIP entry or the processing of its data.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in reading and processing ZIP entries:\n\n1. **`getNextZipEntry()`** - This method is responsible for retrieving the next ZIP entry, which is crucial for the test.\n2. **`readFully(byte[])`** - This method reads the entire content of the input stream into a byte array, which is essential for validating the content of the ZIP entry.\n3. **`readStored(byte[], int, int)`** - This method reads the stored data from the ZIP entry, which is directly related to the test's assertion about the data.\n4. **`processZip64Extra(ZipLong, ZipLong)`** - This method processes ZIP64 extra fields, which may affect how the entry is read if the ZIP file uses ZIP64 extensions.\n5. **`readFirstLocalFileHeader(byte[])`** - This method reads the local file header of the ZIP entry, which is necessary for correctly interpreting the entry's data.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [19, 25, 23, 21, 20]\n}\n```"
