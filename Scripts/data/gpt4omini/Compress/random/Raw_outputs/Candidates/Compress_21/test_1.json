"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSevenFilesSomeNotEmpty` calls the method `testCompress252(7, 2)`. This indicates that the failure might be related to the compression functionality, specifically in handling multiple files, some of which may not be empty.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `SevenZArchiveEntry` and `SevenZOutputFile` classes. The methods that are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further include:\n\n1. **SevenZOutputFile:createArchiveEntry** - This method creates an archive entry and sets properties like directory status and last modified date. If the properties are not set correctly, it could lead to issues during compression.\n2. **SevenZOutputFile:putArchiveEntry** - This method adds an entry to the archive. If there are issues with how entries are added, it could affect the overall compression process.\n3. **SevenZOutputFile:closeArchiveEntry** - This method finalizes the entry in the archive. If it does not handle the finalization correctly, it could lead to corrupted entries.\n4. **SevenZOutputFile:writeFilesInfo** - This method writes information about the files in the archive. If it does not handle the file information correctly, it could lead to issues when reading the archive.\n5. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setName** - This method sets the name of the archive entry. If the name is not set correctly, it could lead to issues when accessing the entry later.\n6. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setLastModifiedDate** - This method sets the last modified date of the entry. If this date is not set correctly, it could lead to inconsistencies in the archive.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 22, 23, 30, 2, 11]\n}\n```"
