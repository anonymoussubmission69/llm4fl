"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testEightEmptyFiles()` calls the method `testCompress252(8, 0)`. This indicates that the failure might be related to the compression functionality, particularly when handling empty files.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `SevenZArchiveEntry` and `SevenZOutputFile` classes, which are responsible for managing the entries in a 7z archive and writing the archive itself. \n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **SevenZOutputFile:createArchiveEntry** - This method creates a new archive entry and sets its properties. If it incorrectly handles empty files, it could lead to issues.\n2. **SevenZOutputFile:putArchiveEntry** - This method adds an entry to the archive. If it does not handle empty entries correctly, it could cause the test to fail.\n3. **SevenZOutputFile:writeFileEmptyFiles** - This method specifically deals with writing empty files to the archive. Since the test is about empty files, this method is crucial to investigate.\n4. **SevenZOutputFile:writeFileEmptyStreams** - Similar to the previous method, this one handles empty streams, which could also be relevant to the test case.\n5. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setHasStream** - This method sets whether the entry has a stream. If it is incorrectly set for empty files, it could lead to failures.\n6. **SevenZArchiveEntry:isDirectory** - This method checks if the entry is a directory. If the logic for determining this is flawed, it could affect how empty files are treated.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 22, 32, 31, 4, 5]\n}\n```"
