"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testSixFilesSomeNotEmpty` calls the method `testCompress252(6, 2)`. This indicates that the failure might be related to the compression functionality, specifically in handling multiple files, some of which may not be empty.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `SevenZArchiveEntry` and `SevenZOutputFile` classes, which are responsible for managing the entries in a 7z archive and writing the output file, respectively. \n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **SevenZOutputFile:createArchiveEntry** - This method creates an archive entry and sets its properties. If there are issues with how entries are created or their properties are set, it could lead to failures in the compression process.\n2. **SevenZOutputFile:putArchiveEntry** - This method adds an entry to the archive. If the entry is not added correctly, it could cause issues during compression.\n3. **SevenZOutputFile:closeArchiveEntry** - This method finalizes the current archive entry. If it does not handle the finalization correctly, it could lead to incomplete or corrupted entries.\n4. **SevenZOutputFile:finish** - This method finalizes the output file. If there are issues in writing the final data, it could lead to a corrupted archive.\n5. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setHasStream** - This method sets whether the entry has a stream. If this is not set correctly, it could affect how the entry is processed during compression.\n6. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setSize** - This method sets the size of the entry. If the size is incorrect, it could lead to issues when reading or writing the archive.\n\nThese methods are critical in the process of creating and finalizing the archive, and any issues in these methods could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 22, 23, 26, 4, 15]\n}\n```"
