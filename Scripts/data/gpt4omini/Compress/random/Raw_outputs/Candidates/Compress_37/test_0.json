"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `survivesBlankLinesInPaxHeader` is designed to check the behavior of the `TarArchiveInputStream` when processing a tar file. The test specifically checks for the correct handling of tar entries and the end of the stream.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`getNextTarEntry()`** (method_id: 42): This method is responsible for retrieving the next tar entry. If there is an issue with how it processes entries, it could lead to the test failure.\n\n2. **`isEOFRecord()`** (method_id: 44): This method checks if the current record is an EOF record. If it incorrectly identifies an EOF, it could cause the test to fail.\n\n3. **`readRecord()`** (method_id: 45): This method reads a record from the input stream. If it does not read the record correctly, it could lead to issues in processing the tar entries.\n\n4. **`paxHeaders()`** (method_id: 46): This method processes PAX headers. If there is a problem in how PAX headers are parsed, it could affect the overall behavior of the `TarArchiveInputStream`.\n\n5. **`isDirectory()`** (method_id: 48): This method checks if the current entry is a directory. If it incorrectly identifies an entry as a directory, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the stream processing.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [42, 44, 45, 46, 48]\n}\n```"
