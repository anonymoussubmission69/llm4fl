"Based on the analysis of the test and the method bodies, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 31,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeFileEmptyStreams' checks for empty streams in the files and writes a header if any are found.
