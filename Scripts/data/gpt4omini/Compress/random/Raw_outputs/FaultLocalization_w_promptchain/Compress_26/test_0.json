However, there is a logical flaw in the while loop where the decrement of 'numToSkip' is placed inside the if condition, which means it will never decrement if 'skipped' is 0. This could lead to an infinite loop if the input stream does not allow skipping, causing the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
