"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `survivesBlankLinesInPaxHeader` is designed to check the behavior of the `TarArchiveInputStream` when processing a tar file. The test specifically checks for the correct handling of tar entries and the end of the stream.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`getNextTarEntry()`** (method_id: 42): This method is responsible for retrieving the next tar entry. If there is an issue with how it processes entries, it could lead to the test failure.\n2. **`paxHeaders()`** (method_id: 46): This method processes Pax headers, which are relevant to the test case. If it fails to handle these headers correctly, it could cause the test to fail.\n3. **`isEOFRecord()`** (method_id: 44): This method checks if the current record is an EOF record. If it incorrectly identifies an EOF, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the stream processing.\n4. **`readRecord()`** (method_id: 45): This method reads a record from the input stream. If it does not read the expected number of bytes or fails to handle the input correctly, it could lead to issues in the test.\n5. **`getRecord()`** (method_id: 43): This method retrieves the next record from the input stream. If it does not return the correct data, it could affect the behavior of `getNextTarEntry()`.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [42, 46, 44, 45, 43]\n}\n```"
