"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test method `workaroundForBrokenTimeHeader` is attempting to read a tar file and validate the properties of a `TarArchiveEntry`. The assertions in the test indicate that it expects a specific name, last modified date, and symbolic link status for the entry being read.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include constructors and methods from the `TarBuffer` and `TarArchiveEntry` classes, which are responsible for reading and parsing the tar file. The following methods are particularly suspicious as they are directly involved in the reading and parsing process:\n\n1. **TarBuffer Constructor**: `TarBuffer(InputStream inStream, int blockSize, int recordSize)` - This initializes the buffer for reading the tar file.\n2. **TarBuffer:readRecord()**: This method reads a record from the input stream, which is crucial for obtaining the tar entry data.\n3. **TarArchiveEntry Constructor**: `TarArchiveEntry(byte[] headerBuf)` - This constructor parses the header buffer to create a `TarArchiveEntry`, which is essential for the assertions in the test.\n4. **TarArchiveEntry:parseTarHeader(byte[] header)**: This method parses the tar header and sets the properties of the `TarArchiveEntry`, including the name and last modified date.\n5. **TarArchiveInputStream:getNextTarEntry()**: This method retrieves the next tar entry, which is directly related to the test's assertions.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could lead to the failure of the test. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 8, 14, 23]\n}\n``` \n\n- **0**: TarBuffer constructor\n- **1**: TarBuffer:readRecord()\n- **4**: TarArchiveEntry constructor\n- **8**: TarArchiveEntry:parseTarHeader()\n- **14**: TarArchiveEntry:parseTarHeader()\n- **23**: TarArchiveInputStream:getNextTarEntry()"
