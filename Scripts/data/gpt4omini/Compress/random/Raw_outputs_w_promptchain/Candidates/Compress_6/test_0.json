"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNotEquals` is designed to check that two `ZipArchiveEntry` objects with different names are not considered equal. The test fails at the assertion `assertFalse(entry1.equals(entry2));`, indicating that the `equals` method is likely not functioning as expected.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. The constructor `ZipArchiveEntry(String name)` which initializes the entry with a name.\n2. The constructor `ZipArchiveEntry(ZipEntry)` which also initializes the entry but is private and not directly related to the test.\n3. The `equals(Object obj)` method which is directly involved in the comparison that the test is asserting.\n\nGiven that the test is failing due to the `equals` method, it is crucial to analyze this method closely. The constructors are also relevant as they set up the state of the objects being compared.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. `ZipArchiveEntry.equals(Object obj)` - This method is directly responsible for the comparison and is the most suspicious.\n2. `ZipArchiveEntry(String name)` - This constructor initializes the name of the entry, which is critical for the `equals` method.\n3. `ZipArchiveEntry(ZipEntry)` - While this method is private and not directly invoked in the test, it may still affect the state of the object if used elsewhere.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 0, 1]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 2 (`equals`) is the primary suspect as it directly impacts the test outcome.\n- Method ID 0 (`ZipArchiveEntry(String name)`) is relevant as it initializes the name used in the equality check.\n- Method ID 1 (`ZipArchiveEntry(ZipEntry)`) is included for completeness, though it is less likely to be the source of the fault."
