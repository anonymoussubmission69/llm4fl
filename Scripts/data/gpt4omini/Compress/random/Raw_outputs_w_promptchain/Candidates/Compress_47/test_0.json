"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `properlyMarksEntriesAsUnreadableIfUncompressedSizeIsUnknown` is designed to check the behavior of the `ZipArchiveInputStream` class when handling different compression methods. The test specifically checks if the method `canReadEntryData` returns the expected boolean values for various `ZipArchiveEntry` methods.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the logic of reading entry data and handling compression methods:\n\n1. **`ZipArchiveInputStream:canReadEntryData(Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/ArchiveEntry;)Z`** - This method is directly called in the test to check if the entry data can be read.\n2. **`ZipUtil:canHandleEntryData(Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/zip/ZipArchiveEntry;)Z`** - This method is called within `canReadEntryData` and determines if the entry data can be handled based on its properties.\n3. **`ZipArchiveEntry:getMethod()I`** - This method retrieves the compression method of the entry, which is crucial for determining if the entry can be read.\n4. **`ZipArchiveEntry:setMethod(I)V`** - This method sets the compression method for the entry, which could affect the outcome of the test if not set correctly.\n5. **`ZipUtil:supportsMethodOf(Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/zip/ZipArchiveEntry;)Z`** - This method checks if the compression method is supported, which is essential for the logic in `canHandleEntryData`.\n\nGiven the relationships and dependencies between these methods, they are all potential sources of the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [12, 33, 23, 24, 35]\n}\n```"
