"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test method `bigEndianWithOverflow` is designed to test the `BitInputStream` class, specifically its ability to read bits from an input stream in big-endian order. The test fails on multiple assertions related to the `readBits` method, which indicates that there may be issues with how bits are being read and cached.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **Constructor of `BitInputStream`**: This method initializes the input stream and sets up the necessary variables. If there is an issue with how the input stream is initialized or how the byte order is set, it could lead to failures in reading bits.\n\n2. **Static initializer of `BitInputStream`**: This method sets up the masks used for bit manipulation. If the masks are incorrectly initialized, it could affect the reading of bits.\n\n3. **`readBits(int count)` method**: This method is crucial as it directly handles the reading of bits from the input stream. The logic within this method is complex, and any errors in handling the bit caching or the byte order could lead to incorrect results, which is evident from the failed assertions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be further examined are:\n\n- `BitInputStream:<init>(Ljava/io/InputStream;Ljava/nio/ByteOrder;)V` (method_id: 0)\n- `BitInputStream:<clinit>()V` (method_id: 1)\n- `BitInputStream:readBits(I)J` (method_id: 2)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
