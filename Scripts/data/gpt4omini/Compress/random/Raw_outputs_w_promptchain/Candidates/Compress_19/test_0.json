"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testExcessDataInZip64ExtraField` is attempting to validate the size of a `ZipArchiveEntry` from a zip file. The test fails when it asserts that the size of the entry is equal to `26101`. \n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include constructors and methods related to `ZipLong`, `ZipArchiveEntry`, and `ZipFile`, among others. Given that the test is concerned with the size of a zip entry, the following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipArchiveEntry:getSize()`** - This method returns the size of the zip entry, which is directly related to the assertion in the test.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile:readCentralDirectoryEntry()`** - This method is responsible for reading the central directory entry, which includes the size of the zip entry.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile:populateFromCentralDirectory()`** - This method populates the zip file's entries from the central directory, which may affect the size of the entries.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.Zip64ExtendedInformationExtraField:getLocalFileDataLength()`** - This method retrieves the local file data length, which is relevant for zip64 entries and could impact the size calculation.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.Zip64ExtendedInformationExtraField:parseFromLocalFileData()`** - This method parses local file data, which may also affect the size of the zip entry.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [29, 92, 90, 81, 83]\n}\n```"
