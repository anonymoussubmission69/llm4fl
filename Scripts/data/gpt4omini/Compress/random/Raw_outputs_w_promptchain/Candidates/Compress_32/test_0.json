"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `shouldReadBigGid` is designed to check the functionality of reading a large group ID from a tar archive entry. The test fails at the assertion `assertEquals(4294967294l, t.getLongGroupId());`, indicating that the method `getLongGroupId()` is likely returning an unexpected value.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`setGroupId(long groupId)`** (method_id: 58): This method sets the group ID, and if it has any constraints or checks that could affect the value being set, it should be reviewed.\n2. **`getLongGroupId()`** (method_id: 57): This method is directly involved in returning the group ID, and since the test fails on its output, it is crucial to analyze its implementation.\n3. **`setBigNumberMode(int bigNumberMode)`** (method_id: 29): This method sets the mode for handling big numbers, which could affect how large values are processed and stored.\n4. **`addPaxHeadersForBigNumbers(Map<String, String> paxHeaders, TarArchiveEntry entry)`** (method_id: 41): This method is responsible for adding headers for big numbers, which may include the group ID. If there are issues in how these headers are processed, it could lead to incorrect values being read.\n5. **`writePaxHeaders(TarArchiveEntry entry, String name, Map<String, String> headers)`** (method_id: 35): This method writes the headers for the tar entry, and any issues here could affect the integrity of the data being read back.\n6. **`getNextTarEntry()`** (method_id: 95): This method retrieves the next tar entry, and if there are issues in how entries are read, it could lead to incorrect values being returned.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [57, 58, 29, 41, 35, 95]\n}\n```"
