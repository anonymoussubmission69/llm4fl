"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testCompressedHeaderWithNonDefaultDictionarySize` is attempting to read entries from a `SevenZFile`. The test fails when it asserts that the count of entries read is equal to 446. \n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test include constructors and methods related to reading headers and entries from the `SevenZFile`. The following methods are particularly suspicious as they are involved in reading and processing the archive:\n\n1. **`SevenZFile:<init>(Ljava/io/File;[B)V`** - This constructor initializes the `SevenZFile` object and reads the headers. If there is an issue with how the headers are read, it could lead to an incorrect count of entries.\n2. **`SevenZFile:readHeaders([B)Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;`** - This method reads the headers of the archive. If the headers are not read correctly, it could affect the number of entries counted.\n3. **`SevenZFile:readStartHeader(J)Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/StartHeader;`** - This method reads the start header of the archive. Issues here could lead to incorrect parsing of the archive.\n4. **`SevenZFile:readPackInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V`** - This method reads pack information from the archive. If it fails to read the correct number of packs, it could affect the entry count.\n5. **`SevenZFile:readUnpackInfo(Ljava/io/DataInput;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Archive;)V`** - This method reads unpack information. Similar to the previous method, issues here could lead to incorrect entry counts.\n6. **`SevenZFile:readFolder(Ljava/io/DataInput;)Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/sevenz/Folder;`** - This method reads folder information from the archive. If it fails to read the correct folder structure, it could affect the entry count.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, leading to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11]\n}\n```"
