"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testUtf8FileRoundtripNoEFSImplicitUnicodeExtra` is likely testing the functionality of writing and reading a UTF-8 encoded file, specifically focusing on handling Unicode extra fields. The stack trace does not provide specific error messages, but it indicates that the test is related to file handling and encoding.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ZipArchiveOutputStream` class, which is responsible for writing ZIP files. The methods that are particularly relevant to the test and may contain faults include:\n\n1. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:putArchiveEntry`** - This method is responsible for adding an entry to the ZIP archive. If there are issues with how entries are handled, it could lead to failures in the roundtrip test.\n2. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:writeLocalFileHeader`** - This method writes the local file header for an entry. If there are issues with encoding or extra fields, this could cause the test to fail.\n3. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:writeOut`** - This method is responsible for writing data to the output stream. If there are issues with the data being written, it could lead to discrepancies when reading the file back.\n4. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:closeArchiveEntry`** - This method finalizes the current entry. If there are issues during the closing process, it could affect the integrity of the ZIP file.\n5. **`ZipArchiveOutputStream:finish`** - This method finalizes the ZIP output stream. If there are issues during the finishing process, it could lead to incomplete or corrupted ZIP files.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, leading to the failure of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 7, 10, 3, 2]\n}\n```"
