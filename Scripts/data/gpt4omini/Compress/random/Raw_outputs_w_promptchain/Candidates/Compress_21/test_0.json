"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testSixFilesSomeNotEmpty()` calls the method `testCompress252(6, 2)`. This indicates that the failure might be related to the compression functionality, specifically in handling multiple files, some of which may not be empty.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `SevenZArchiveEntry` and `SevenZOutputFile` classes. The methods that are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further include:\n\n1. **SevenZOutputFile:createArchiveEntry** - This method creates an archive entry and sets properties like directory status and last modified date. If the properties are not set correctly, it could lead to issues during compression.\n2. **SevenZOutputFile:putArchiveEntry** - This method adds an entry to the archive. If there are issues with how entries are added, it could affect the overall compression process.\n3. **SevenZOutputFile:closeArchiveEntry** - This method finalizes the entry in the archive. If it does not handle the finalization correctly, it could lead to corrupted entries.\n4. **SevenZOutputFile:write** - This method writes data to the output stream. If the data is not written correctly, it could lead to incomplete or corrupted files.\n5. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setHasStream** - This method sets whether the entry has a stream. If this is not set correctly, it could affect how the entry is processed during compression.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 22, 23, 24, 4]\n}\n```"
