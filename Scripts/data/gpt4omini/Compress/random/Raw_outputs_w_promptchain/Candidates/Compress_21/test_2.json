"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testNineFilesSomeNotEmpty` calls the method `testCompress252(9, 2)`. This indicates that the failure might be related to the compression functionality, specifically when handling multiple files, some of which may not be empty.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `SevenZArchiveEntry` and `SevenZOutputFile` classes, which are responsible for handling the compression and archiving of files. The methods that are particularly relevant to the compression process and could potentially lead to the fault include:\n\n1. **SevenZOutputFile:createArchiveEntry** - This method creates an archive entry for a file, which is crucial when adding files to the archive.\n2. **SevenZOutputFile:putArchiveEntry** - This method adds an archive entry to the output file, which is essential for the compression process.\n3. **SevenZOutputFile:closeArchiveEntry** - This method finalizes the current archive entry, which could lead to issues if not handled correctly.\n4. **SevenZOutputFile:write** - This method writes data to the output file, which is critical for the actual compression process.\n5. **SevenZOutputFile:finish** - This method finalizes the output file, which is important for ensuring that all data is correctly written and the file is properly closed.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, especially in the context of handling multiple files and ensuring that the compression process is correctly executed.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 22, 23, 24, 26]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes the method IDs of the potentially suspicious methods that need further analysis to identify the fault in the system under test."
