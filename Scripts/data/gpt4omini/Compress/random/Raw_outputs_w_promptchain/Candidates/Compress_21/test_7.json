"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testEightEmptyFiles()` calls the method `testCompress252(8, 0);`. This indicates that the failure might be related to the compression functionality when handling empty files.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `SevenZArchiveEntry` and `SevenZOutputFile` classes, which are responsible for handling the archive entries and the output file operations. \n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed:\n\n1. **SevenZOutputFile:createArchiveEntry** - This method creates an archive entry and sets its properties. If it does not handle empty files correctly, it could lead to issues.\n2. **SevenZOutputFile:putArchiveEntry** - This method adds an entry to the output file. If it does not manage empty entries properly, it could cause failures.\n3. **SevenZOutputFile:writeFileEmptyFiles** - This method specifically deals with writing empty files to the archive. It is crucial to check how it handles empty files.\n4. **SevenZOutputFile:writeFileEmptyStreams** - Similar to the previous method, this one handles empty streams, which could also be relevant to the test case.\n5. **SevenZOutputFile:finish** - This method finalizes the output file. If there are issues with how it handles the entries, it could lead to failures.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 22, 32, 31, 26]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the context of handling empty files and streams, which is the focus of the failing test."
