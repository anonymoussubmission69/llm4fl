"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSevenFilesSomeNotEmpty` calls the method `testCompress252(7, 2)`. This indicates that the failure might be related to the compression functionality, specifically in handling multiple files, some of which may not be empty.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `SevenZArchiveEntry` and `SevenZOutputFile` classes, which are responsible for managing the entries in a 7z archive and writing the output file, respectively. \n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **SevenZOutputFile:createArchiveEntry** - This method creates an archive entry and sets its properties. If there are issues with how entries are created or their properties are set, it could lead to failures in the test.\n2. **SevenZOutputFile:putArchiveEntry** - This method adds an entry to the archive. If the entry is not added correctly, it could cause the test to fail.\n3. **SevenZOutputFile:closeArchiveEntry** - This method finalizes the current archive entry. If there are issues in finalizing the entry, it could lead to incorrect archive structure.\n4. **SevenZOutputFile:write** - This method writes data to the output stream. If the data is not written correctly, it could lead to corruption in the output file.\n5. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setHasStream** - This method sets whether the entry has a stream. If this is not set correctly, it could affect how the entry is processed.\n6. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setSize** - This method sets the size of the entry. If the size is incorrect, it could lead to issues when reading the archive.\n7. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setCompressedSize** - Similar to the size, if the compressed size is not set correctly, it could lead to failures when decompressing.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 22, 23, 24, 4, 15, 16]\n}\n```"
