"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n1. **`createArchiveInputStream`** (Method ID: 0)\n   - This method is responsible for creating an `ArchiveInputStream` based on the provided archiver name. If the archiver name is not handled correctly, it could lead to issues during the unarchiving process.\n\n2. **`createArchiveOutputStream`** (Method ID: 1)\n   - Similar to the input stream method, this method creates an `ArchiveOutputStream`. Any issues in the creation of the output stream could affect the archiving process.\n\n3. **`CpioArchiveOutputStream` constructor** (Method ID: 2 and 3)\n   - The constructors for `CpioArchiveOutputStream` initialize the output stream. If there are issues with the initialization, it could lead to problems when writing entries to the archive.\n\n4. **`putNextEntry`** (Method ID: 6)\n   - This method is crucial for adding a new entry to the archive. If there are issues with the entry being added (e.g., incorrect size or format), it could lead to failures during the unarchiving process.\n\n5. **`writeHeader`** (Method ID: 7)\n   - This method writes the header for the archive entry. If the header is not written correctly, it could lead to issues when reading the entry back.\n\n6. **`getNextEntry`** (Method ID: 60)\n   - This method retrieves the next entry from the archive. If the entry retrieval is faulty, it could lead to failures in the test assertions.\n\n7. **`readNewEntry`** (Method ID: 58)\n   - This method reads a new entry from the archive. If there are issues with reading the entry, it could lead to incorrect data being processed.\n\n8. **`IOUtils.copy`** (Method ID: 48 and 49)\n   - These methods are used to copy data from one stream to another. If there are issues with the data being copied, it could lead to incomplete or corrupted entries.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 60, 58, 48, 49]\n}\n```"
