"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test is designed to check if a `NullPointerException` is thrown when instantiating the `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` class with null parameters. The constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream` is the only method covered by the failed test, which is suspicious because it directly relates to the test's purpose.\n\nThe constructor's method signature indicates that it takes two parameters: a `Checksum` and an `InputStream`. Since the test is passing `null` for both parameters, it is likely that the constructor does not handle null values properly, leading to the `NullPointerException`.\n\nThus, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is the constructor of `ChecksumCalculatingInputStream`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
