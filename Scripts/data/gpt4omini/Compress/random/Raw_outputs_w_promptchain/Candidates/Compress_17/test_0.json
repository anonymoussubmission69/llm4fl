"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCompress197` is attempting to read entries from a tar archive using the `TarArchiveInputStream` class. The test fails when it encounters an `IOException`, which suggests that there may be an issue with how the tar entries are being read or processed.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`TarArchiveInputStream:getNextTarEntry()`** - This method is responsible for retrieving the next tar entry. If there is an issue with reading the tar entries, this method is likely to be involved.\n2. **`TarArchiveInputStream:getRecord()`** - This method reads a record from the underlying buffer. If there is a problem with reading the data, it could lead to an `IOException`.\n3. **`TarBuffer:readRecord()`** - This method reads a record from the input stream. If the input stream is not functioning correctly, it could cause issues in the `getRecord()` method.\n4. **`TarBuffer:readBlock()`** - This method reads a block of data from the input stream. If there are issues with the input stream or the way data is being read, it could affect the reading of records.\n5. **`TarBuffer:close()`** - This method closes the input stream. If there are issues with resource management, it could lead to exceptions being thrown.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the potentially suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [26, 27, 10, 11, 12]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
