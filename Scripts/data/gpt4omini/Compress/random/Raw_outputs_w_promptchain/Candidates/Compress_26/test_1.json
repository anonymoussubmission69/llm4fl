"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test method `skipUsingRead` is attempting to use a custom `StreamWrapper` that overrides the `skip` method of `FilterInputStream`. The overridden `skip` method always returns 0, which means that it does not actually skip any bytes, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect behavior in the `IOUtils.skip` method.\n\nThe covered method identified from the failed test is `org.apache.commons.compress.utils.IOUtils:skip`, which is responsible for skipping bytes in an `InputStream`. The logic in this method relies on the ability to skip bytes, and if the `skip` method of the input stream returns 0, it could lead to unexpected results.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`skipUsingRead`**: The test method that is directly involved in the failure.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.compress.utils.IOUtils:skip`**: The method that is being tested and is likely to be affected by the behavior of the overridden `skip` method.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe methods that need to be analyzed further are the ones mentioned above, as they are directly related to the failure observed in the test.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]  // 0 for IOUtils.skip, 1 for skipUsingRead\n}\n```"
