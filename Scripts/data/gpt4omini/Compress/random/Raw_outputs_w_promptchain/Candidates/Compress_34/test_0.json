"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testParseReparse` is designed to validate the behavior of the `parseFromLocalFileData` method in the `X7875_NewUnix` class. The test involves various byte arrays that represent different UID and GID values, and it checks the expected outcomes using assertions.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the test failed, which suggests that one or more methods involved in the parsing and data handling may have issues. The methods that are covered by the failed test include constructors and utility methods related to `ZipLong`, `ZipShort`, and `X7875_NewUnix`.\n\n### Suspicious Methods to Analyze:\n1. **`X7875_NewUnix:parseFromLocalFileData([BII)V`** - This method is directly involved in parsing the byte array and is likely where the fault originates.\n2. **`X7875_NewUnix:getUID()J`** - This method retrieves the UID, which is asserted in the test.\n3. **`X7875_NewUnix:getGID()J`** - This method retrieves the GID, which is also asserted in the test.\n4. **`X7875_NewUnix:getLocalFileDataData()[B`** - This method returns the local file data, which is compared against the expected data in the test.\n5. **`ZipUtil:signedByteToUnsignedInt(B)I`** - This utility method converts a signed byte to an unsigned integer, which is used in the parsing process.\n6. **`ZipUtil:unsignedIntToSignedByte(I)B`** - This utility method converts an unsigned integer to a signed byte, which may also be involved in the data handling.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe methods listed above are critical to the functionality being tested and should be analyzed for potential faults. The failure could stem from incorrect parsing logic, improper handling of byte arrays, or issues with the conversion methods.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 14, 15, 20, 10, 11]\n}\n```"
