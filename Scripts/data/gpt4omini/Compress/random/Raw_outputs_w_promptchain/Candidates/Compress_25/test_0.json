"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testReadingOfFirstStoredEntry` is attempting to read a ZIP archive entry and validate its size and content. The failure likely occurs during the reading of the ZIP entry, which involves several methods related to reading and processing ZIP files.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`getNextZipEntry()`** - This method is responsible for retrieving the next ZIP entry. If there is an issue with reading the entry, it could lead to the test failure.\n2. **`readFully(byte[])`** - This method reads the entire content of the input stream into a byte array. If it does not read the expected number of bytes, it could cause the assertion to fail.\n3. **`readFirstLocalFileHeader(byte[])`** - This method reads the header of the first local file in the ZIP. If the header is not read correctly, it could lead to issues in processing the ZIP entry.\n4. **`processZip64Extra(Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/zip/ZipLong;Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/zip/ZipLong;)`** - This method processes ZIP64 extra fields, which may be relevant if the ZIP file uses ZIP64 format.\n5. **`readStored(byte[], int, int)`** - This method reads stored data from the ZIP entry. If the data is not read correctly, it could lead to incorrect assertions in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [19, 25, 20, 21, 23]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the process of reading and validating the ZIP entry, and any issues within them could propagate and lead to the test failure observed."
