"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `testWriteNonAsciiDirectoryNamePosixMode` is designed to test the functionality of writing a non-ASCII directory name to a tar archive. The test involves creating a `TarArchiveEntry` with a non-ASCII name and checking if it is correctly written and recognized as a directory.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`TarArchiveOutputStream:setAddPaxHeadersForNonAsciiNames(Z)V`** - This method is responsible for setting whether to add PAX headers for non-ASCII names. If this is not set correctly, it could lead to issues with how non-ASCII names are handled.\n\n2. **`TarArchiveOutputStream:putArchiveEntry(Lorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/ArchiveEntry;)V`** - This method is responsible for putting an archive entry into the tar output stream. If there are issues in how entries are added, it could affect the integrity of the archive.\n\n3. **`TarArchiveEntry:getName()Ljava/lang/String;`** - This method retrieves the name of the tar entry. If the name is not set or retrieved correctly, it could lead to failures in the test.\n\n4. **`TarArchiveEntry:isDirectory()Z`** - This method checks if the entry is a directory. If the logic determining whether an entry is a directory is flawed, it could lead to incorrect assertions in the test.\n\n5. **`TarArchiveEntry:writeEntryHeader([BLorg/apache/commons/compress/archivers/zip/ZipEncoding;Z)V`** - This method writes the entry header for the tar entry. If there are issues in how the header is written, it could affect the entire entry's validity.\n\n6. **`TarUtils:formatNameBytes(Ljava/lang/String;[BII)I`** - This utility method formats the name bytes for the tar entry. If the formatting is incorrect, it could lead to issues with how the name is stored in the archive.\n\n7. **`TarUtils:computeCheckSum([B)J`** - This method computes the checksum for the tar entry. If the checksum is not computed correctly, it could lead to integrity issues with the archive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [11, 12, 28, 37, 40, 44, 50]\n}\n```"
