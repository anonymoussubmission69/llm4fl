"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `survivesBlankLinesInPaxHeader` is designed to check the behavior of the `TarArchiveInputStream` when it encounters blank lines in the Pax header of a tar file. The test specifically interacts with the `getNextTarEntry()` method of the `TarArchiveInputStream` class, which is responsible for reading the next entry in the tar archive.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the test failed while asserting the expected behavior of the `TarArchiveEntry` object returned by `getNextTarEntry()`. This suggests that the methods involved in reading and parsing the tar entries, particularly those related to the Pax headers, are likely candidates for investigation.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`getNextTarEntry()`** - This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for retrieving the next tar entry. Any issues in this method could lead to the test failure.\n2. **`paxHeaders()`** - This method is called within `getNextTarEntry()` and is responsible for parsing the Pax headers. If there are issues in how the headers are parsed, it could affect the outcome of the test.\n3. **`isPaxHeader()`** - This method checks if the current entry is a Pax header. If this logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect behavior in the handling of tar entries.\n4. **`isGlobalPaxHeader()`** - Similar to `isPaxHeader()`, this method checks for global Pax headers and could also impact the test if it does not function correctly.\n5. **`parsePaxHeaders(InputStream)`** - This method is responsible for reading and parsing the Pax headers from the input stream. Any issues here could directly affect the test's outcome.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [42, 46, 24, 25, 47]\n}\n```"
