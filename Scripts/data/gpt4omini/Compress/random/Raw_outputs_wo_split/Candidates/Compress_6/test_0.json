"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNotEquals` is designed to check that two `ZipArchiveEntry` objects with different names are not considered equal. The test fails at the assertion `assertFalse(entry1.equals(entry2));`, indicating that the `equals` method is likely not functioning as expected.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. The constructor `ZipArchiveEntry(String name)` which initializes the entry with a name.\n2. The constructor `ZipArchiveEntry(ZipEntry entry)` which also initializes various attributes.\n3. The `equals(Object obj)` method which is responsible for comparing two `ZipArchiveEntry` objects.\n\nGiven that the failure occurs during the equality check, the most suspicious method to analyze is the `equals` method, as it directly relates to the failure. The constructors are also relevant because they set up the state of the objects being compared.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0 and 1 are constructors that initialize the `ZipArchiveEntry` objects, which could affect the state used in the `equals` method.\n- Method ID 2 is the `equals` method itself, which is the direct cause of the test failure."
