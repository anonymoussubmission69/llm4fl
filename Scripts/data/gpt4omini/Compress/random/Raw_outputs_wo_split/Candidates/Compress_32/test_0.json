"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the test `shouldReadBigGid` is designed to check the functionality of reading a large group ID from a tar archive entry. The test fails at the assertion `assertEquals(4294967294l, t.getLongGroupId());`, indicating that the method `getLongGroupId()` is likely returning an unexpected value.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`setGroupId(long groupId)`** (method_id: 58): This method sets the group ID for the `TarArchiveEntry`. If the group ID is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect values being returned by `getLongGroupId()`.\n\n2. **`getLongGroupId()`** (method_id: 57): This method retrieves the group ID. Since the test is failing on this assertion, it is crucial to check how this value is being computed and returned.\n\n3. **`setBigNumberMode(int bigNumberMode)`** (method_id: 29): This method sets the mode for handling big numbers. If the mode is not set correctly, it could affect how large values are processed.\n\n4. **`putArchiveEntry(ArchiveEntry archiveEntry)`** (method_id: 32): This method is responsible for adding an entry to the archive. If the entry is not being added correctly, it could lead to issues when reading back the values.\n\n5. **`writePaxHeaders(TarArchiveEntry entry, String name, Map<String, String> headers)`** (method_id: 35): This method writes PAX headers, which may include the group ID. If the headers are not written correctly, it could affect the retrieval of the group ID.\n\n6. **`addPaxHeadersForBigNumbers(Map<String, String> paxHeaders, TarArchiveEntry entry)`** (method_id: 41): This method adds headers for big numbers, including the group ID. If this method fails to add the correct headers, it could lead to incorrect values being read.\n\n7. **`getNextTarEntry()`** (method_id: 95): This method retrieves the next tar entry. If the entry is not being read correctly, it could lead to incorrect values being returned.\n\n8. **`parseTarHeader(byte[] header, ZipEncoding encoding)`** (method_id: 73): This method parses the tar header, which includes the group ID. If the parsing is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect values being set.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [57, 58, 29, 32, 35, 41, 95, 73]\n}\n```"
