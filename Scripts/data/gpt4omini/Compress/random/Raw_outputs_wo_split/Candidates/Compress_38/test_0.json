"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `survivesPaxHeaderWithNameEndingInSlash` is designed to check the behavior of the `TarArchiveInputStream` when processing a tar file. The test specifically checks if the `getNextTarEntry()` method correctly retrieves the next entry and if the entry's name matches the expected value.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the test failed when trying to assert the expected entry name. This suggests that the issue may lie within the methods involved in reading the tar entries, particularly in the `getNextTarEntry()` method and its related methods.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`getNextTarEntry()`** - This method is directly involved in retrieving the next entry from the tar stream.\n2. **`isEOFRecord(byte[])`** - This method checks if the current record is an EOF record, which could affect the reading of entries.\n3. **`readRecord()`** - This method reads the next record from the input stream, which is crucial for correctly processing the tar entries.\n4. **`paxHeaders()`** - This method processes Pax headers, which are relevant to the test case since the test is checking for a specific entry format.\n5. **`parsePaxHeaders(InputStream)`** - This method parses the Pax headers from the input stream, which could also impact the retrieval of entries.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [44, 46, 49, 50, 51]\n}\n```"
