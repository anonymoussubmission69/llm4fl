"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReadingOfFirstStoredEntry` is attempting to read a ZIP file entry and validate its size and content. The failure likely occurs during the reading of the ZIP entry, which involves several methods related to reading and processing ZIP files.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`getNextZipEntry()`** - This method is responsible for retrieving the next ZIP entry. If there is an issue with reading the entry, it could lead to the test failure.\n2. **`readFully(byte[])`** - This method reads the entire content of the input stream into a byte array. If it does not read the expected number of bytes, it could cause the assertion to fail.\n3. **`readFirstLocalFileHeader(byte[])`** - This method reads the header of the ZIP entry. If the header is not read correctly, it could lead to incorrect entry size or data.\n4. **`readStored(byte[], int, int)`** - This method reads the stored data of the ZIP entry. If it does not read the correct amount of data, it could lead to mismatched sizes.\n5. **`count(int)` and `count(long)`** - These methods keep track of the number of bytes read. If there is an issue with counting, it could affect the assertions made in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [19, 25, 20, 23, 0, 1]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test."
