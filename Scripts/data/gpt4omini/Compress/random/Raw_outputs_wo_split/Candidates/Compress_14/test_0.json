"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test method `workaroundForBrokenTimeHeader` is attempting to read a tar file and validate the properties of a `TarArchiveEntry`. The assertions in the test indicate that it expects a specific name and last modified date for the entry being read.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include constructors and methods from the `TarBuffer` and `TarArchiveEntry` classes, which are responsible for reading and parsing the tar file. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **TarBuffer Constructor**: The constructors of `TarBuffer` are responsible for initializing the input stream and setting up the buffer. If there is an issue with how the input stream is handled, it could lead to problems when reading the tar entries.\n\n2. **TarBuffer:readRecord()**: This method reads a record from the input stream. If there is an issue with reading the data correctly, it could lead to incorrect entries being processed.\n\n3. **TarArchiveEntry:parseTarHeader()**: This method parses the header of a tar entry. If the header is not parsed correctly, it could lead to incorrect values for the entry's properties, which would cause the assertions in the test to fail.\n\n4. **TarArchiveInputStream:getNextTarEntry()**: This method retrieves the next tar entry. If there is an issue in this method, it could prevent the correct entry from being returned, leading to assertion failures.\n\n5. **TarArchiveEntry Constructor**: The constructor that takes a byte array as an argument is responsible for initializing the entry based on the header. If the header is malformed or not read correctly, it could lead to incorrect initialization.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 14, 23]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are critical in the process of reading and parsing the tar file, and any issues within them could propagate and lead to the test failures observed."
