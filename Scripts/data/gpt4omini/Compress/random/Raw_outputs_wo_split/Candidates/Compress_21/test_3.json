"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSevenEmptyFiles` calls the method `testCompress252(7, 0)`. This indicates that the failure might be related to the compression functionality, particularly when handling empty files.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `SevenZArchiveEntry` and `SevenZOutputFile` classes. The methods that are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further include:\n\n1. **SevenZOutputFile:createArchiveEntry** - This method creates an archive entry and sets properties like directory status and last modified date. If it incorrectly handles empty files, it could lead to issues.\n2. **SevenZOutputFile:putArchiveEntry** - This method adds an entry to the archive. If it does not handle empty entries correctly, it could cause failures.\n3. **SevenZOutputFile:writeFileEmptyFiles** - This method writes information about empty files to the archive. If it has a bug, it could directly affect the test case.\n4. **SevenZOutputFile:writeFileEmptyStreams** - Similar to the above, this method handles empty streams, which is crucial for the test involving empty files.\n5. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setHasStream** - This method sets whether the entry has a stream. If it is incorrectly set for empty files, it could lead to issues during compression.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, leading to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 22, 31, 32, 4]\n}\n```"
