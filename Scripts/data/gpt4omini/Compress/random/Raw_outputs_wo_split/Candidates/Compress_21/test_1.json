"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSevenFilesSomeNotEmpty` calls the method `testCompress252(7, 2)`. This indicates that the failure might be related to the compression functionality, specifically in handling multiple files, some of which may not be empty.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include various methods from the `SevenZArchiveEntry` and `SevenZOutputFile` classes. The methods that are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further include:\n\n1. **SevenZOutputFile:createArchiveEntry** - This method creates an archive entry and sets properties like directory status and last modified date. If the logic here is incorrect, it could lead to issues when compressing files.\n2. **SevenZOutputFile:putArchiveEntry** - This method adds an entry to the archive. If it fails to handle the entries correctly, it could lead to the test failure.\n3. **SevenZOutputFile:closeArchiveEntry** - This method finalizes the entry in the archive. If there are issues with how streams are handled or if the entry is not properly closed, it could cause problems.\n4. **SevenZOutputFile:writeFilesInfo** - This method writes information about the files in the archive. If it does not correctly handle the files, it could lead to incorrect archive creation.\n5. **SevenZArchiveEntry:setHasStream** - This method sets whether the entry has a stream. If this is not set correctly, it could lead to issues when reading or writing the archive.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, leading to the failure of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 22, 23, 30, 4]\n}\n```"
