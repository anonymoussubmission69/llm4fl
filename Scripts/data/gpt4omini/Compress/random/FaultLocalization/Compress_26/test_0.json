However, there is a logical flaw in the while loop where it checks if 'numToSkip' is greater than 0, but it does not properly handle the case when 'skipped' is 0. The 'return' statement is incorrectly placed inside the loop, which will cause the method to exit prematurely without skipping the intended number of bytes. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the test case that relies on skipping bytes, making this method highly suspicious.",
