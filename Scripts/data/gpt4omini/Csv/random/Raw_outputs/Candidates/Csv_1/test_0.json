"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testGetLineNumberWithCR` is failing because it expected the line number to be `1`, but it was `0`. This indicates that the method responsible for calculating the line number is not functioning as expected.\n\nThe following methods are relevant to the failure:\n\n1. **CSVParser.getLineNumber()** - This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for returning the current line number.\n2. **CSVParser.getRecord()** - This method is also called in the test and may affect the line number calculation.\n3. **CSVParser.<init>()** - The constructor initializes the parser and may set up the state incorrectly.\n4. **CSVLexer.nextToken()** - This method is responsible for reading tokens and may influence how line breaks are handled.\n5. **CSVLexer.isEndOfLine()** - This method checks if a character is an end-of-line character, which is crucial for line number calculation.\n6. **CSVFormat.withLineSeparator()** - This method sets the line separator and may affect how line breaks are interpreted.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [22, 24, 20, 37, 30, 18]\n}\n``` \n\n### Reasoning:\n- **22 (CSVParser.getRecord)**: This method is involved in reading records and may affect the line number.\n- **24 (CSVParser.getLineNumber)**: Directly related to the failure as it returns the line number.\n- **20 (CSVParser.<init>)**: The constructor initializes the parser and could lead to incorrect state.\n- **37 (CSVLexer.nextToken)**: This method processes tokens and could affect how line breaks are handled.\n- **30 (CSVLexer.isEndOfLine)**: This method checks for line breaks, which is critical for line number calculation.\n- **18 (CSVFormat.withLineSeparator)**: This method sets the line separator, which could influence how line breaks are interpreted in the parser. \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure."
