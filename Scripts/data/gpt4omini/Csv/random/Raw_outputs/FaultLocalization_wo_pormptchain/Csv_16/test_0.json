"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 39,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'nextRecord' method in CSVParser is responsible for retrieving the next record from the CSV input.
