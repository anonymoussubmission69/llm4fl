"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 56,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'toMap()' method is directly called in the test and is responsible for converting the CSVRecord to a Map.
