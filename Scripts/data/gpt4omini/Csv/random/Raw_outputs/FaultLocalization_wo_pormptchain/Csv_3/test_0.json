"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 46,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'nextRecord()' in the CSVParser class is responsible for parsing the next record from the input. Since the test is failing due to a mismatch in expected and actual records, this method is highly suspicious as it directly deals with the parsing logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getRecords()' in the CSVParser class retrieves all records from the parser. It calls 'nextRecord()' and aggregates the results, making it suspicious as it could be the source of the incorrect record count or content.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parseEncapsulatedToken()' in the CSVLexer class handles the parsing of tokens that are encapsulated. Given that the test involves escaping and encapsulation, this method could be responsible for the incorrect parsing of the quoted content.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 36,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'parseSimpleToken()' in the CSVLexer class is responsible for parsing simple tokens. Since the test involves various token types, this method could also be a source of the issue if it fails to correctly identify or parse tokens.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of the CSVParser class initializes the parser with a Lexer. If there are issues with how the Lexer is set up or interacts with the input, it could lead to parsing errors, making this method somewhat suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
