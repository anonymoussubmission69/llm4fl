"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testNoHeaderMap` is designed to check if the `getHeaderMap()` method of the `CSVParser` class returns `null` when there is no header present in the CSV data.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `NullPointerException` occurred in the `getHeaderMap()` method, which suggests that there is an issue with how the header map is being initialized or accessed.\n3. The `getHeaderMap()` method calls `initializeHeader()`, which is responsible for setting up the header map. If `initializeHeader()` does not properly initialize the header map, it could lead to a `NullPointerException` when `getHeaderMap()` tries to return it.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `getHeaderMap()` (method_id: 23): This is the method that directly caused the failure.\n- `initializeHeader()` (method_id: 24): This method is responsible for initializing the header map and may contain the fault.\n- `CSVParser` constructor (method_id: 21): This method initializes the `CSVParser` and calls `validate()` on the `CSVFormat`, which could affect how the header is set up.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [21, 23, 24]\n}\n```"
