This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the `CSVParser` is handling line breaks, particularly with the `getLineNumber()` method.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`org.apache.commons.csv.CSVParser:getLineNumber()I`** - This method is directly involved in returning the line number, which is the source of the failure.\n2. **`org.apache.commons.csv.Lexer:getLineNumber()I`** - This method is called by `CSVParser.getLineNumber()` and may be responsible for the incorrect line number.\n3. **`org.apache.commons.csv.ExtendedBufferedReader:getLineNumber()I`** - This method is also involved in tracking the line number and could be contributing to the issue.\n4. **`org.apache.commons.csv.CSVParser:getRecord()Lorg/apache/commons/csv/CSVRecord;`** - This method is called after `getLineNumber()` and may also be related to how records are being parsed and counted.\n5. **`org.apache.commons.csv.CSVParser:<init>(Ljava/io/Reader;Lorg/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat;)V`** - The constructor initializes the parser and may have implications on how the input is processed.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3, 7, 6]\n}\n```"
