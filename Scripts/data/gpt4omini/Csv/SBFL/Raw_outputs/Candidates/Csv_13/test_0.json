"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMySqlNullStringDefault` is failing because it expected the null string representation to be `\"\\N\"` but received `null`. This indicates that the method `getNullString()` in the `CSVFormat` class is likely returning an unexpected value.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `getNullString()`: This method is directly related to the failure since it is expected to return the null string representation.\n2. `validate()`: This method is responsible for validating the parameters of the `CSVFormat` class, which may include the null string representation.\n3. The constructor of `CSVFormat`: This method initializes the `nullString` variable, which is crucial for the `getNullString()` method.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `getNullString()`\n- `validate()`\n- The constructor of `CSVFormat`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nIn this JSON:\n- `1` corresponds to `getNullString()`\n- `2` corresponds to `validate()`\n- `7` corresponds to the constructor of `CSVFormat`"
