"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'format' method is responsible for creating the formatted CSV string. Since the test checks if the formatted string does not end with 'null', any issue in this method could lead to the failure observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'printRecord' method in the CSVPrinter class is called within the 'format' method. If there are issues in how records are printed, it could affect the final output of the format method.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'withRecordSeparator' method is used to set the record separator. If the record separator is incorrectly set or handled, it could lead to unexpected formatting results.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'validate' method checks the integrity of the CSVFormat settings.
