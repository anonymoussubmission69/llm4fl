"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'validate' method checks for duplicate header names in the CSV format. The test failed because it expected an IllegalArgumentException but received an IllegalStateException, which indicates that the validation logic is likely where the issue lies.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'withHeader' method is responsible for setting the header names. It directly interacts with the 'validate' method, and if it does not handle duplicate headers correctly, it could lead to the validation failure observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of 'CSVFormat' initializes the header. If the header is not set correctly or if it allows duplicates during initialization, it could contribute to the validation failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The static initialization of 'DEFAULT' may not be directly related to the failure, but it sets up the default CSV format which could be used in the test. If it does not enforce unique headers, it could indirectly lead to issues.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
