"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNullRecordSeparatorCsv106` is designed to check the behavior of the `CSVFormat` class when formatting a CSV string. The test specifically asserts that the formatted string is not null and does not end with \"null\". The failure occurred in the assertion that checks if the formatted string does not end with \"null\".\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test include:\n\n1. `CSVFormat:format(Object...)` - This method is responsible for formatting the CSV string. It uses `CSVPrinter` to print the record.\n2. `CSVPrinter:print(Object, CharSequence, int, int)` - This method handles the actual printing of the values to the output.\n3. `CSVFormat:withSkipHeaderRecord(boolean)` - This method configures whether to skip the header record.\n4. `CSVFormat:<init>(char, Character, Quote, Character, Character, boolean, boolean, String, String, String[], boolean)` - This is the constructor for `CSVFormat`, which initializes various parameters.\n5. `CSVPrinter:printRecord(Object...)` - This method prints a record of values.\n6. `CSVPrinter:<init>(Appendable, CSVFormat)` - This constructor initializes the `CSVPrinter`.\n7. `CSVPrinter:println()` - This method prints a new line.\n8. `CSVPrinter:print(Object)` - This method prints a single value.\n9. `CSVFormat:isEscaping()` - This method checks if escaping is enabled.\n10. `CSVFormat:newFormat(char)` - This static method creates a new `CSVFormat` instance.\n11. `CSVFormat:getRecordSeparator()` - This method retrieves the record separator.\n12. `CSVFormat:withHeader(String...)` - This method configures the headers for the CSV.\n13. `CSVFormat:isQuoting()` - This method checks if quoting is enabled.\n14. `CSVFormat:getDelimiter()` - This method retrieves the delimiter used in the CSV.\n\nGiven that the failure is related to the formatted string ending with \"null\", the most suspicious methods to analyze further are:\n\n- `CSVFormat:format(Object...)` (method_id: 0) - This is the primary method being tested and is directly responsible for the output.\n- `CSVPrinter:print(Object, CharSequence, int, int)` (method_id: 1) - This method is involved in the printing logic and may be where the \"null\" value is being introduced.\n- `CSVPrinter:printRecord(Object...)` (method_id: 4) - This method handles the printing of the entire record and may also contribute to the issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4]\n}\n```"
