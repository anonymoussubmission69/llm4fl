"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testEscapedMySqlNullValue` is failing because the expected token content does not match the actual token content. The expected content is `\"character\\\\NEscaped\"` while the actual content is `\"characterNEscaped\"`. This suggests that there is an issue with how the escape character is being handled in the lexer.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **CSVFormatBuilder** constructor (`method_id: 0`): This method initializes various parameters including escape characters. If the escape character is not set correctly, it could lead to issues in token parsing.\n  \n2. **CSVFormat** constructor (`method_id: 1`): Similar to the builder, this method also initializes the format including escape characters. Any misconfiguration here could propagate to the lexer.\n\n3. **Lexer** constructor (`method_id: 2`): This method initializes the lexer with the format and could be directly responsible for how tokens are read and interpreted.\n\n4. **Lexer:mapNullToDisabled** (`method_id: 12`): This method maps null characters to a disabled character. If the mapping is incorrect, it could affect how null values are represented in the lexer.\n\n5. **Lexer:isEscape** (`method_id: 16`): This method checks if a character is an escape character. If this method is not functioning correctly, it could lead to incorrect parsing of escape sequences.\n\n6. **Lexer:isQuoteChar** (`method_id: 18`): This method checks if a character is a quote character. If the quote character is not recognized correctly, it could lead to issues in tokenization.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the methods related to the initialization of the lexer and the handling of escape characters are particularly suspicious.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 12, 16, 18]\n}\n```"
