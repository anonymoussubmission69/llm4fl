"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDuplicateHeaderEntries` is expected to throw an `IllegalStateException` when parsing a CSV string with duplicate header entries. The stack trace indicates that the exception was not thrown as expected, leading to the test failure.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `initializeHeader()`\n2. `nextRecord()`\n3. `CSVParser` constructor\n4. `CSVFormat` constructor\n5. `addRecordValue()`\n6. `parse()`\n7. `withHeader()`\n8. `Assertions.notNull()`\n\n### Suspicious Methods Analysis:\n- **`initializeHeader()`**: This method is responsible for initializing the header map. If it does not handle duplicate headers correctly, it could lead to the `IllegalStateException`.\n- **`nextRecord()`**: This method retrieves the next record from the CSV. If it does not correctly process the records, it could also lead to issues with header handling.\n- **`CSVParser` constructor**: This initializes the parser and calls `initializeHeader()`. If the constructor does not set up the parser correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n- **`addRecordValue()`**: This method adds values to the record. If it does not handle the addition of values correctly, it could lead to an incorrect state.\n- **`parse()`**: This is the entry point for parsing the CSV string. If it does not correctly invoke the necessary methods or handle the input, it could lead to the failure.\n- **`withHeader()`**: This method sets the headers for the CSV format. If it does not validate or handle duplicate headers, it could lead to the exception.\n- **`Assertions.notNull()`**: While this method checks for null parameters, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the exception but could be involved in the validation process.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe methods that need to be analyzed further to find the fault are primarily those that deal with header initialization and record processing. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
