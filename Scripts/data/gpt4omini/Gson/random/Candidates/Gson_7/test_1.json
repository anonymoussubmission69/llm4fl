    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMapDeserializationWithUnquotedIntegerKeys` is designed to test the deserialization of a JSON string into a `Map<Integer, String>`. The JSON string provided is `\"{123:\\\"456\\\"}\"`, which is expected to be deserialized into a map with one entry.\n2. The stack trace indicates a `JsonSyntaxException` caused by an `IllegalStateException`, specifically stating \"Expected an int but was STRING\". This suggests that the deserialization process encountered a string where it expected an integer key.\n3. The methods involved in the deserialization process include various methods from the `Gson` class and its related classes, particularly those that handle type tokens and the reading of JSON.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method is responsible for initiating the deserialization process.\n2. **`com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;`** - This method handles the reading of the JSON input.\n3. **`com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory:create(Lcom/google/gson/Gson;Lcom/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken;)Lcom/google/gson/TypeAdapter;`** - This method creates a type adapter for maps, which is crucial for handling the deserialization of the map structure.\n4. **`com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory$Adapter:read(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;)Ljava/util/Map;`** - This method reads the JSON and constructs the map, making it a key point of failure.\n5. **`com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader:nextInt()I`** - This method is responsible for reading an integer from the JSON input, and it is where the exception is thrown.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [29, 31, 66, 89, 77]\n}\n```"
