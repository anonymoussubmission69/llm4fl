"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDoubleSupertype` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing two types. The expected type is `<? super java.lang.Number>` while the actual type returned is `<? super ? super java.lang.Number>`. This indicates a potential issue in the type resolution logic.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods related to type handling in the Gson library. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`supertypeOf(Type bound)`**: This method is directly involved in determining the supertype of a given type. Since the test is comparing supertype resolutions, any fault in this method could lead to the observed failure.\n\n2. **`equals(Type a, Type b)`**: This method is responsible for checking equality between two types. If there is a flaw in how types are compared, it could also lead to the assertion failure.\n\n3. **`checkArgument(boolean condition)`**: This method checks if a condition is true. While it may not directly relate to the type resolution, if any precondition fails, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **`checkNotPrimitive(Type type)`**: This method checks if a type is not primitive. If the type handling logic incorrectly identifies a type as primitive, it could affect the type resolution.\n\n5. **`checkNotNull(Object obj)`**: This method checks for null values. If any of the types being compared are null, it could lead to unexpected results.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 4, 1, 6, 0]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
