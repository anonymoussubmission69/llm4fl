"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMapDeserializationWithUnquotedIntegerKeys` is designed to test the deserialization of a JSON string into a `Map<Integer, String>`. The JSON string provided is `\"{123:\\\"456\\\"}\"`, which has an unquoted integer key.\n2. The stack trace indicates a `JsonSyntaxException` caused by an `IllegalStateException` stating \"Expected an int but was STRING\". This suggests that the deserialization process is encountering a type mismatch when trying to read the key from the JSON.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 29)**: This method is responsible for starting the deserialization process from a JSON string.\n- **`com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 31)**: This method handles the deserialization from a `JsonReader`, which is crucial for understanding how the JSON is being parsed.\n- **`com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory:create(Lcom/google/gson/Gson;Lcom/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken;)Lcom/google/gson/TypeAdapter;` (method_id: 66)**: This method creates a `TypeAdapter` for the `Map`, which is essential for handling the specific deserialization of the `Map<Integer, String>`.\n- **`com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory$Adapter:read(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;)Ljava/util/Map;` (method_id: 89)**: This method reads the JSON and constructs the `Map`, making it critical to investigate how it processes the keys and values.\n\nThese methods are interconnected in the deserialization process and are likely where the fault lies.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [29, 31, 66, 89]\n}\n```"
