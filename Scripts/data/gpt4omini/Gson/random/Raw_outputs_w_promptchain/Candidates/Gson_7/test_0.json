"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMapDeserializationWithUnquotedLongKeys` is attempting to deserialize a JSON string into a `Map<Long, String>`. The JSON string provided has a long key that is not quoted, which is likely causing the deserialization to fail.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `JsonSyntaxException` is thrown, which is caused by an `IllegalStateException` stating \"Expected a long but was STRING\". This suggests that the deserialization process is encountering a type mismatch.\n3. The methods involved in the deserialization process, particularly those related to `Gson` and `TypeToken`, are critical to investigate as they handle the conversion of JSON to Java objects.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. `com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 29) - This method is responsible for starting the deserialization process from a JSON string.\n2. `com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 31) - This method handles the deserialization from a `JsonReader`, which is part of the process that leads to the exception.\n3. `com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory:create(Lcom/google/gson/Gson;Lcom/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken;)Lcom/google/gson/TypeAdapter;` (method_id: 64) - This method creates a `TypeAdapter` for maps, which is crucial for handling the deserialization of the map structure.\n4. `com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory$Adapter:read(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;)Ljava/util/Map;` (method_id: 87) - This method reads the JSON and constructs the map, and is likely where the type mismatch occurs.\n5. `com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader:nextLong()J` (method_id: 94) - This method is responsible for reading a long value from the JSON input, and it is directly related to the exception thrown.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [29, 31, 64, 87, 94]\n}\n```"
