"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'peekNumber()' is responsible for parsing numbers from the input. Given that the test is failing when trying to read a negative zero ('-0'), this method is highly suspicious as it may not be handling negative numbers correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'nextString()' is called after 'peek()' and is expected to return the string representation of the number. If 'peek()' does not correctly identify '-0' as a valid number, this method may also be implicated in the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'peek()' is responsible for determining the type of the next token. If it incorrectly identifies '-0' as something other than a number, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'beginArray()' is called to start reading an array. While it may not directly relate to the parsing of '-0', if the state management is incorrect, it could indirectly affect how subsequent methods behave.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
