"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSuperSubtype` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual values. The assertion is checking if the result of `supertypeOf(subtypeOf(Number.class))` is equal to `subtypeOf(Object.class)`. \n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `assertEquals` method, which suggests that the issue may lie in the methods involved in the type resolution and comparison. The following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`supertypeOf`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for returning the supertype of a given type.\n2. **`subtypeOf`** - This method is also directly involved in the test and is responsible for returning the subtype of a given type.\n3. **`equals`** - This method is used to compare two types for equality, which is crucial for the assertion to pass.\n4. **`checkArgument`** - This method is used to validate conditions, and while it may not be directly related to the failure, it could be worth checking if any conditions are being violated.\n5. **`checkNotNull`** - Similar to `checkArgument`, this method checks for null values, which could potentially lead to issues if not handled properly.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potentially suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 8, 4, 1, 0]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
