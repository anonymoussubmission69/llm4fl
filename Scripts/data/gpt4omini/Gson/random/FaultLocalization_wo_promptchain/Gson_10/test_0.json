The expected output is `{\"part\":[\"42\"]}`, while the actual output is `{\"part\":[42]}`. This indicates that the serialization process is not correctly handling the primitive type as expected.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 22,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toJson(Object src)' is responsible for converting an object to its JSON representation.
