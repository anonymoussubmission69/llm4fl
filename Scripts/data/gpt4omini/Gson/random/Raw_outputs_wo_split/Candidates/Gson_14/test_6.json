"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDoubleSubtype` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing two types. The expected type is `<? extends java.lang.Number>` but the actual type returned is `<? extends ? extends java.lang.Number>`. This indicates a potential issue with how subtypes are being handled in the `subtypeOf` method or related methods that deal with type checking and equality.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to this failure include:\n\n1. **checkNotNull**: This method checks if an object is null. While it may not directly relate to the type comparison, it is a utility that ensures that the types being compared are not null.\n2. **checkArgument**: This method checks if a condition is true. It could be relevant if there are assumptions about the types being passed that are not being met.\n3. **equals**: This method compares two types for equality. Given that the failure is related to type comparison, this method is highly suspicious.\n4. **typeToString**: This method converts a type to its string representation. While it may not directly cause the failure, it could be involved in debugging or logging the types.\n5. **checkNotPrimitive**: This method checks if a type is primitive. It may be relevant if the types being compared are expected to be non-primitive.\n6. **subtypeOf**: This method is directly involved in creating a subtype of a given type. Since the failure is related to the subtype comparison, this method is the most suspicious.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as potentially suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
