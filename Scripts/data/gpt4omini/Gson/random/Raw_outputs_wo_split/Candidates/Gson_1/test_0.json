"Based on the analysis of the test body and the stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is attempting to serialize an instance of the `Bar` class using Gson, which is a library for converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown, specifically mentioning that a parameterized type is expected but a class was provided instead. This suggests that there is an issue with how the types are being handled during serialization.\n3. The error originates from the `TypeInfoFactory` class, particularly in the `getActualType` method, which is responsible for determining the actual type of a field.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.google.gson.TypeInfoFactory:getActualType`** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is likely where the error originates.\n2. **`com.google.gson.TypeInfoFactory:getTypeInfoForField`** - This method is called to get type information for fields, which may be related to the serialization issue.\n3. **`com.google.gson.Gson:toJson`** - This method is responsible for converting an object to JSON, and since the error occurs during this process, it should be examined.\n4. **`com.google.gson.Gson:toJsonTree`** - This method is called within `toJson` and is responsible for creating a JSON tree representation of the object, which may also be involved in the error.\n5. **`com.google.gson.JsonSerializationContextDefault:serialize`** - This method is involved in the serialization process and may be relevant to the issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [100, 99, 12, 13, 76]\n}\n```"
