"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMapDeserializationWithUnquotedLongKeys` is attempting to deserialize a JSON string into a `Map<Long, String>`. The JSON string provided has a long key that is not quoted, which is likely causing the deserialization to fail.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `JsonSyntaxException` is thrown due to an `IllegalStateException` stating \"Expected a long but was STRING\". This suggests that the deserialization process is encountering a type mismatch.\n3. The methods involved in the deserialization process, particularly those related to `Gson` and `TypeToken`, are critical to investigate. The methods that are covered by the failed test include constructors and methods from `TypeToken`, `Gson`, and various internal classes related to type adapters.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. `com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 29) - This method is responsible for starting the deserialization process.\n2. `com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 31) - This method handles the reading of the JSON input.\n3. `com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory:create(Lcom/google/gson/Gson;Lcom/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken;)Lcom/google/gson/TypeAdapter;` (method_id: 64) - This method creates a type adapter for maps, which is crucial for handling the deserialization of the map structure.\n4. `com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory$Adapter:read(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;)Ljava/util/Map;` (method_id: 87) - This method reads the JSON and constructs the map, making it essential to understand how it processes the keys and values.\n5. `com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader:nextLong()J` (method_id: 94) - This method is directly involved in reading long values from the JSON input and is likely where the type mismatch occurs.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [29, 31, 64, 87, 94]\n}\n```"
