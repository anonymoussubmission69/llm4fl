"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMapDeserializationWithUnquotedIntegerKeys` is attempting to deserialize a JSON string into a `Map<Integer, String>`. The JSON string provided is `\"{123:\\\"456\\\"}\"`, which is valid JSON but uses an unquoted integer key.\n2. The stack trace indicates a `JsonSyntaxException` caused by an `IllegalStateException` stating \"Expected an int but was STRING\". This suggests that the deserialization process is encountering a type mismatch, likely due to the way the Gson library is interpreting the JSON input.\n3. The methods involved in the deserialization process include various methods from the `Gson` class and the `TypeToken` class, which are responsible for handling type information and the actual deserialization logic.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. `com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 29) - This method is responsible for starting the deserialization process from a JSON string.\n2. `com.google.gson.Gson:fromJson(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;Ljava/lang/reflect/Type;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (method_id: 31) - This method handles the deserialization from a `JsonReader`, which is likely where the type mismatch occurs.\n3. `com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory:create(Lcom/google/gson/Gson;Lcom/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken;)Lcom/google/gson/TypeAdapter;` (method_id: 66) - This method creates a type adapter for maps, which is crucial for handling the deserialization of the `Map<Integer, String>`.\n4. `com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory$Adapter:read(Lcom/google/gson/stream/JsonReader;)Ljava/util/Map;` (method_id: 89) - This method reads the JSON input and constructs the map, where the actual deserialization logic is implemented.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [29, 31, 66, 89]\n}\n```"
