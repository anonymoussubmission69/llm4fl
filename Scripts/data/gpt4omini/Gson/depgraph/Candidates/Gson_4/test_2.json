This exception is thrown in the `beforeValue` method of the `JsonWriter` class.\n\nThe stack trace shows the following sequence of method calls leading to the exception:\n1. `JsonWriter.value(boolean value)` - This method is called first, which then calls `beforeValue(false)`.\n2. `JsonWriter.beforeValue(boolean root)` - This method is where the exception is thrown.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test that are relevant to the failure are:\n- `beforeValue(boolean root)` (method_id: 0)\n- `value(boolean value)` (method_id: 1)\n- `peek()` (method_id: 2) - This method is called within `beforeValue` and may influence the state leading to the exception.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- `beforeValue(boolean root)` - Directly throws the exception.\n- `value(boolean value)` - Initiates the call that leads to the exception.\n- `peek()` - May affect the state that leads to the exception.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
