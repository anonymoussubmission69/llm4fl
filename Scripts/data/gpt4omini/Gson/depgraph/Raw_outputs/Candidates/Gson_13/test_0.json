"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNegativeZero` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` when asserting the expected output of `reader.nextString()` against the actual output. The expected output is `\"-0\"` but the actual output is `\"0\"`. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the methods responsible for parsing negative numbers.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **peekNumber()**: This method is responsible for peeking at the number in the input. It handles the parsing of negative numbers and could be where the issue arises.\n2. **nextString()**: This method retrieves the next string from the input. Since the test is expecting a string representation of a number, any issues in this method could lead to the failure.\n3. **doPeek()**: This method is involved in determining the type of the next token. If it incorrectly identifies the token type, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n4. **beginArray()**: This method starts reading an array. If the input is not being processed correctly, it could affect subsequent reads.\n5. **nextNonWhitespace()**: This method is responsible for skipping whitespace. If it fails to correctly identify the start of the number, it could lead to parsing errors.\n6. **fillBuffer()**: This method fills the buffer with data from the input. If it does not correctly read the input, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n7. **peek()**: This method is responsible for peeking at the next token. If it does not correctly identify the token, it could lead to incorrect parsing.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]\n}\n```"
