"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSkipValue_filledJsonObject` is designed to test the `skipValue()` method of the `JsonTreeReader` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred in the `skipValue()` method at line 262 of `JsonTreeReader.java`. This suggests that there may be an issue with how the stack is being managed within this method.\n3. The `peek()` method is also called within `skipValue()`, which could potentially lead to the exception if the stack size is not managed correctly.\n4. The `popStack()` method is responsible for reducing the stack size, and if it is called incorrectly, it could also lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. `skipValue()` - This is the method where the exception occurred.\n2. `peek()` - This method is called within `skipValue()` and could be contributing to the issue.\n3. `popStack()` - This method is responsible for managing the stack size and could be a source of the problem.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 4, 6]\n}\n```"
