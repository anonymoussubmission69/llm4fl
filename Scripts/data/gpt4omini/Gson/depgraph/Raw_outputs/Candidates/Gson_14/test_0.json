"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSuperSubtype` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing two types. The expected type is `<?>` while the actual type is `<? super ? extends java.lang.Number>`. This indicates a potential issue with how the types are being resolved or compared.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`supertypeOf(Type bound)`**: This method is responsible for creating a supertype wildcard. If there is an issue in how it constructs the wildcard type, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n\n2. **`subtypeOf(Type bound)`**: Similar to `supertypeOf`, this method creates a subtype wildcard. Any issues in its implementation could also affect the test outcome.\n\n3. **`equals(Type a, Type b)`**: This method is used to compare two types for equality. Since the test is failing on an assertion that compares two types, this method is critical to analyze for potential faults.\n\n4. **`WildcardTypeImpl` constructor**: This constructor is used to create instances of `WildcardTypeImpl`, which are involved in the type comparison. If there are issues in how the bounds are set, it could lead to incorrect type representations.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 3, 1, 0]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 2**: `supertypeOf`\n- **Method ID 3**: `subtypeOf`\n- **Method ID 1**: `equals`\n- **Method ID 0**: `WildcardTypeImpl` constructor\n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
