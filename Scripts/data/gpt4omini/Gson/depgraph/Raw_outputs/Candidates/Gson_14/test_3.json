"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDoubleSupertype` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing two types. The expected type is `<? super java.lang.Number>` while the actual type returned is `<? super ? super java.lang.Number>`. This indicates a potential issue in the type resolution logic, particularly in how supertype relationships are being handled.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to this failure include:\n\n1. **`WildcardTypeImpl` constructor** - This method is responsible for creating instances of wildcard types, which are crucial in type resolution.\n2. **`equals` method** - This method checks for equality between two types, which is directly involved in the assertion that is failing.\n3. **`supertypeOf` method** - This method is likely responsible for determining the supertype of a given type, which is central to the test case.\n4. **`typeToString` method** - While this method is not directly related to the failure, it may be useful for debugging type representations.\n5. **`checkNotPrimitive` method** - This method ensures that the type being checked is not a primitive type, which may indirectly affect type resolution.\n\nGiven the context of the failure and the methods involved, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]\n}\n```\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Method 0 (`WildcardTypeImpl` constructor)**: This method is responsible for creating wildcard types, which are essential in the type hierarchy being tested.\n- **Method 1 (`equals`)**: This method is directly involved in the assertion failure, as it compares the expected and actual types.\n- **Method 2 (`supertypeOf`)**: This method is critical as it determines the supertype of a given type, which is the core of the test case.\n- **Method 3 (`typeToString`)**: While not directly related to the failure, understanding type representations can help in debugging.\n- **Method 5 (`checkNotPrimitive`)**: Ensuring that types are not primitive may affect the behavior of type resolution, making it relevant for analysis."
