"Based on the analysis of the test case and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method `subtypeOf` (ID: 1)**:\n   - **Body**: This method creates a `WildcardType` with a single upper bound. The test is failing because it expects a subtype of `Number`, but it seems to be returning a subtype of a subtype (`<? extends ? extends java.lang.Number>`). This indicates that the method is not correctly handling the creation of subtypes.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Modify the `subtypeOf` method to ensure that it correctly creates a `WildcardType` that directly represents a subtype of `Number` without nesting.\n\n2. **Method `equals` (ID: 0)**:\n   - **Body**: This method compares two `Type` objects. It checks various conditions for equality, including handling `WildcardType`. However, it does not seem to be the direct cause of the failure since the failure is more about the creation of the subtype rather than the comparison.\n   - **Potential Fix**: While this method may not need immediate changes, ensure that it correctly handles cases where types are nested or have multiple bounds.\n\n3. **Method `checkNotPrimitive` (ID: 4)**:\n   - **Body**: This method checks if a type is primitive and throws an exception if it is. It does not directly relate to the failure in the test case, which is about subtype creation and comparison.\n   - **Potential Fix**: No changes are necessary for this method as it does not contribute to the failure.\n\n### Re-Ranking\nGiven the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n1. **Method `subtypeOf` (ID: 1)** - Most suspicious due to direct involvement in the failure.\n2. **Method `equals` (ID: 0)** - Less suspicious but still relevant due to its role in type comparison.\n3. **Method `checkNotPrimitive` (ID: 4)** - Least suspicious as it does not relate to the failure.\n\n### JSON Output\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
