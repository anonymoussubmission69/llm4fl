The stack trace indicates that a `JsonParseException` is thrown here when the input is not a string, which is the root cause of the failure.\n\n2. **`com.google.gson.TypeAdapter:fromJson(Ljava/io/Reader;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (Method ID: 3)**: This method calls the `read` method of `DefaultDateTypeAdapter`, and since it is part of the chain that leads to the exception, it is also suspicious.\n\n3. **`com.google.gson.TypeAdapter:fromJson(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;` (Method ID: 4)**: This method is responsible for converting a JSON string into an object and calls the `fromJson` method that leads to the `read` method. It is part of the chain that could lead to the fault.\n\n4. **`com.google.gson.DefaultDateTypeAdapter:<init>(Ljava/lang/Class;)V` (Method ID: 1)**: This constructor initializes the `DefaultDateTypeAdapter` and is relevant as it sets up the context for the `read` method.\n\n5. **`com.google.gson.JsonParseException:<init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V` (Method ID: 0)**: While this method is just a constructor for the exception, it is important to note as it is the point where the error is thrown.\n\nThe other methods listed do not seem to be directly related to the failure based on the stack trace and the context of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n```"
