It calls `ISO8601Utils.parse`, which is likely where the parsing logic resides.\n\n2. **`parse` (method_id: 4)**: This method is responsible for parsing the date string in the ISO 8601 format. Since the test is specifically checking for ISO 8601 date formats, any issues in this method could lead to the failure observed.\n\n3. **`DefaultDateTypeAdapter` (method_id: 8)**: This method is responsible for deserializing the JSON element into a Date object. It calls `deserializeToDate`, which is where the exception is thrown.\n\n4. **`checkOffset` (method_id: 5)**: This method checks if the current character in the string matches the expected character. If there is an issue with the date format, this method could be involved in the failure.\n\n5. **`indexOfNonDigit` (method_id: 2)**: This method is used to find non-digit characters in the date string. If the date string is malformed, this method could also contribute to the failure.\n\n6. **`parseInt` (method_id: 6)**: This method is used to parse integer values from the date string. If the date string contains unexpected characters, this could lead to parsing errors.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [9, 4, 8, 5, 2, 6]\n}\n```"
