The test `testSkipValue_emptyJsonObject` is designed to test the `skipValue()` method of the `JsonTreeReader` class. The test fails with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at line 262 in the `skipValue()` method.\n2. The exception indicates that there is an attempt to access an index in an array that is out of bounds, which suggests that the `stackSize` variable may not be properly managed, leading to an invalid access in the `popStack()` or `peekStack()` methods.\n3. The `skipValue()` method calls `popStack()`, which decreases `stackSize` and accesses the `stack` array. If `stackSize` is 0, this will lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n4. The `peek()` method is also relevant as it checks the `stackSize` before accessing the stack, and it could be involved in the logic that leads to the invalid state.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `skipValue()` (method_id: 0)\n- `popStack()` (method_id: 1)\n- `peek()` (method_id: 4)\n- `peekStack()` (method_id: 5)\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4, 5]\n}\n```"
