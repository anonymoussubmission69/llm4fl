"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testMapDeserializationWithUnquotedLongKeys` is attempting to deserialize a JSON string into a `Map<Long, String>`. The JSON string provided has a long key that is not quoted, which is likely causing the deserialization to fail.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `JsonSyntaxException` is thrown due to an `IllegalStateException` stating \"Expected a long but was STRING\". This suggests that the deserialization process is encountering a type mismatch.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.google.gson.Gson.fromJson(String json, Type typeOfT)`** - This method is responsible for initiating the deserialization process. It is crucial to check how it handles the input JSON and the expected type.\n2. **`com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter.read(JsonReader in)`** - This method is involved in reading the JSON into a Map structure. It is essential to understand how it processes keys and values, especially in the context of type expectations.\n3. **`com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader.nextLong()`** - This method is directly related to reading a long value from the JSON. Since the error indicates a type mismatch involving a long, this method should be examined to see how it handles different JSON token types.\n4. **`com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader.promoteNameToValue(JsonReader reader)`** - This method is responsible for promoting a name token to a value token. It is relevant because it may be involved in interpreting the key in the JSON object.\n\nThese methods are interconnected in the deserialization process and could potentially propagate the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [31, 2, 23, 1]\n}\n```"
