"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDoubleSupertype` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing two types. The expected type is `<? super java.lang.Number>` while the actual type returned is `<? super ? super java.lang.Number>`. This indicates a potential issue in the method responsible for determining the supertype.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `Gson` library, particularly in the `Gson$Types` class. The following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **supertypeOf(Type bound)** - This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for determining the supertype of a given type. The logic here could be leading to the incorrect type being returned.\n\n2. **checkNotPrimitive(Type type)** - This method checks if the type is primitive. If the type being passed to `supertypeOf` is incorrectly identified as primitive, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **equals(Type a, Type b)** - This method is used to compare two types. If the comparison logic is flawed, it could lead to the assertion failure observed in the test.\n\n4. **checkArgument(boolean condition)** - This method is used to validate conditions. If any of the conditions checked here are not properly validated, it could lead to incorrect behavior in the methods that rely on it.\n\n5. **WildcardTypeImpl constructor** - This constructor is used to create instances of `WildcardTypeImpl`. If the bounds are not set correctly, it could lead to issues when determining the supertype.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 5, 4, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
