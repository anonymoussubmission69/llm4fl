"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSuperSubtype` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing two types. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `assertEquals` method, which is comparing the result of `supertypeOf` and `subtypeOf` methods from the `$Gson$Types` class.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **supertypeOf**: This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the fault originates. It constructs a `WildcardType` based on the provided bound.\n2. **subtypeOf**: This method is also directly involved in the test and constructs a `WildcardType` based on the provided bound.\n3. **WildcardTypeImpl constructor**: This method is called by both `supertypeOf` and `subtypeOf` to create instances of `WildcardType`. If there is an issue with how the bounds are being set, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n4. **checkNotPrimitive**: This method is used to ensure that the type is not primitive. If the type being passed is primitive, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n5. **equals**: This method is used to compare two types. If there is an issue with how types are being compared, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
