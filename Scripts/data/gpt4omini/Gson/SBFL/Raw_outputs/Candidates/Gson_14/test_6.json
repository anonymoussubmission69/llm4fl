"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testDoubleSubtype` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing two types. The expected type is `<? extends java.lang.Number>` but the actual type returned is `<? extends ? extends java.lang.Number>`. This indicates a potential issue with how subtypes are being resolved or represented in the code.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to this failure include:\n\n1. **`subtypeOf(Type bound)`**: This method is directly involved in creating a subtype representation. Since the test is about subtypes, this method is highly suspicious.\n2. **`checkNotPrimitive(Type type)`**: This method checks if the type is not primitive. While it may not directly cause the failure, it could be part of the type validation process.\n3. **`equals(Type a, Type b)`**: This method is used to compare two types for equality. Since the failure is related to type comparison, this method is also suspicious.\n4. **`typeToString(Type type)`**: This method converts a type to its string representation. While it may not directly cause the failure, it could be involved in debugging or logging type information.\n5. **`checkArgument(boolean condition)`**: This method checks a condition and may be involved in validating the arguments passed to other methods.\n6. **`checkNotNull(Object obj)`**: This method checks if an object is null. It may not be directly related to the failure but is part of the validation process.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the most suspicious methods to analyze further are `subtypeOf`, `equals`, and `checkNotPrimitive`, as they are directly related to type handling and comparison.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 2]\n}\n```"
