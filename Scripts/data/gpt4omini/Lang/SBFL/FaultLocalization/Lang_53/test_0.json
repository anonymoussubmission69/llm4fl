While it contains complex logic for rounding, it does not seem to directly cause the test failure. However, if the 'round' method does not correctly handle null dates, this method may not be executed as intended. Thus, it is less suspicious than the 'round' method.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
