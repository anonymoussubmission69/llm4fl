"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testReflectionDoubleArray` is failing because it expected a null value but received an empty object representation instead. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how null values are being handled in the `reflectionToString` or related methods.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' is responsible for converting an object to its string representation. It calls another 'toString' method with multiple parameters, which may not handle null values correctly, leading to the empty object representation instead of null.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString' calls 'ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString', which is likely responsible for the string representation of the object. If this method does not handle null arrays properly, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArray' is involved in appending array details to a string buffer. If it does not handle null arrays correctly, it could contribute to the failure when a null array is passed.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail' is responsible for appending details of an array to a buffer. If it does not handle null items in the array correctly, it could lead to incorrect string representations.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendFieldsIn' checks if the class is an array and calls 'reflectionAppendArray'. If the array is null, it should ideally handle it, but it is less directly related to the failure than the previous methods.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getRegistry' retrieves a registry map. It is less likely to be directly related to the null handling issue in the context of the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'isRegistered' checks if a value is in the registry map. It is the least suspicious as it does not deal with string representations or null values directly.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
