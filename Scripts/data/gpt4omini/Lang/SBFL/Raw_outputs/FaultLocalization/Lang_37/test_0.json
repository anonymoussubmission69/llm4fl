The test case indicates that an ArrayStoreException is thrown when trying to add a Long to an Integer array. This suggests that the method does not properly handle type safety when combining arrays of different types, which is a critical issue in Java's type system. The lack of checks for type compatibility before performing the array copy operation makes this method highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
