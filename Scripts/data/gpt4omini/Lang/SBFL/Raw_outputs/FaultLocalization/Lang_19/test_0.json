The stack trace indicates a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, which suggests that the method is trying to access a character at an index that is out of the bounds of the input string. Specifically, the check for the '&' character and the subsequent access of characters at 'index + 1' and 'start' could lead to this exception if the input string is shorter than expected. This makes it highly suspicious as it directly correlates with the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
