"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test is checking the behavior of the `indexOfAny` method from the `StringUtils` class. The test is failing because it expected a return value of `2` but received `0`. This indicates that the method is not correctly identifying the index of the search character in the given character sequence.\n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **Method 1: `indexOfAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**\n   - This method is designed to find the index of any character from the `searchChars` array in the `CharSequence` `cs`.\n   - The method first checks if either `cs` or `searchChars` is empty. If they are, it should return a default value (not shown in the provided snippet).\n   - It then iterates through each character in `cs` and checks if it matches any character in `searchChars`.\n   - The method is suspicious because if the input `searchChars` is not correctly populated or if the logic for returning the index is flawed, it could lead to incorrect results, as seen in the test failure.\n\n2. **Method 2: `indexOfAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`**\n   - This method is a wrapper that converts the `searchChars` string into a character array and calls the first method.\n   - It also checks if `cs` or `searchChars` is empty and returns the result of the first method.\n   - This method is less suspicious because it relies on the first method for the actual logic. However, if the conversion from `String` to `char[]` is not handled correctly, it could lead to issues.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\nGiven the analysis, the first method is more directly responsible for the failure in the test case, as it contains the core logic for finding the index. The second method is a wrapper and less likely to be the source of the problem.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method contains the core logic for finding the index of any character from the searchChars array in the CharSequence.
