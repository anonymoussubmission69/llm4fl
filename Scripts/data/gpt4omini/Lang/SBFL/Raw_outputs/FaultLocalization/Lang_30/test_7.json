"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test is checking the behavior of the `indexOfAnyBut` method from the `StringUtils` class. The test expects the method to return the index of the first character in the string that is not present in the `searchChars` string. However, the test fails because the expected value is 2, but the actual value returned is 3.\n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **Method 0: `indexOfAnyBut`**\n   - This method is responsible for finding the index of the first character in the input string `str` that is not present in the `searchChars` string. \n   - The method starts by checking if either `str` or `searchChars` is empty using the `isEmpty` method. If either is empty, it does not proceed to the loop.\n   - The loop iterates through each character in `str`, checking if it exists in `searchChars`. If a character is found that is not in `searchChars`, it returns the index of that character.\n   - The method is suspicious because it does not handle the case where the input string is empty or where all characters are present in `searchChars`, which could lead to incorrect index returns.\n\n2. **Method 1: `isEmpty`**\n   - This method checks if a given `CharSequence` is either `null` or has a length of 0.\n   - It is a utility method that is used in `indexOfAnyBut` to determine if the input strings are valid for processing.\n   - This method is less suspicious because it simply checks for null or empty strings and does not directly affect the logic of finding the index in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\nGiven the analysis, the `indexOfAnyBut` method is more suspicious due to its role in the failing test case, while the `isEmpty` method is a straightforward utility function that does not contribute to the failure.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The indexOfAnyBut method is responsible for finding the index of the first character not in searchChars.
