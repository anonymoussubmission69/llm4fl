"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testReduce()` is testing the `reduce()` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is failing at the assertion that checks if the numerator and denominator of the reduced fraction are equal to expected values.\n2. The stack trace indicates that the expected value was `<1>` but the actual value was `<100>`, which suggests that the `reduce()` method is not returning the correct reduced fraction.\n3. The `reduce()` method relies on the `greatestCommonDivisor()` method to compute the GCD, which is critical for reducing the fraction.\n4. The `getFraction()` method is also involved in creating the `Fraction` instances used in the tests, and any issues in its implementation could lead to incorrect fractions being created.\n5. The `getNumerator()` and `getDenominator()` methods are simple getters, but if the internal state of the `Fraction` object is incorrect, they will return incorrect values.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and need to be analyzed further:\n\n- `reduce()` (method_id: 0)\n- `greatestCommonDivisor(int, int)` (method_id: 1)\n- `getFraction(int, int)` (method_id: 2)\n\nThe other methods (`getNumerator()`, `getDenominator()`, and the constructor) are less likely to be the source of the fault, but they could still be relevant if the internal state of the `Fraction` object is not set correctly.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
