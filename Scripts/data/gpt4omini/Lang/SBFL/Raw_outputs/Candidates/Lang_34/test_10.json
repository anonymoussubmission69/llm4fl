"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testReflectionBooleanArray` is designed to test the behavior of converting a boolean array to a string representation using reflection.\n2. The failure occurs when the expected output is `<null>`, but the actual output is `{}`. This indicates that the method responsible for handling null arrays is not functioning as expected.\n3. The stack trace points to the method `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` in the `ToStringBuilderTest` class, which suggests that this method is likely involved in the handling of null values.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`reflectionToString(Object object)`** - This method is responsible for converting an object to its string representation using reflection. It directly calls `ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString(object)`, which is crucial for understanding how null values are handled.\n   \n2. **`toString(Object object)`** - This method is a wrapper that calls another `toString` method with additional parameters. It is important to check how it processes null values.\n\n3. **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail(StringBuffer buffer, String fieldName, Object array)`** - This method is responsible for appending details of an array to a string buffer. It contains logic that may not handle null arrays correctly.\n\n4. **`reflectionAppendArray(Object array)`** - This method appends an array to the string representation. If it does not handle null arrays properly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n5. **`appendFieldsIn(Class<?> clazz)`** - This method checks if the class is an array and calls `reflectionAppendArray`. If the class is null, it may not be handled correctly.\n\n6. **`toString()`** - This method is responsible for generating the final string representation. If it does not handle null objects correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 12]\n}\n```"
