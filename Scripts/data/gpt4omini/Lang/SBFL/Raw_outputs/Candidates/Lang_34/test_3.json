"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSelfInstanceTwoVarsReflectionObjectCycle` is failing due to an assertion that expected a `null` value but received an empty object (`{}`). The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method, which is likely related to the `toString` method of the `ToStringBuilder` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ToStringBuilder` and `ReflectionToStringBuilder` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious as they are directly involved in the string representation of objects and could lead to the observed failure:\n\n1. `org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ToStringBuilder:reflectionToString(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is responsible for generating a string representation of an object using reflection.\n2. `org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionToStringBuilder:toString(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method is a key part of the reflection-based string representation.\n3. `org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionToStringBuilder:toString(Ljava/lang/Object;Lorg/apache/commons/lang3/builder/ToStringStyle;ZZLjava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/String;` - This method handles the actual conversion of an object to a string, considering various styles.\n4. `org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionToStringBuilder:getValue(Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)Ljava/lang/Object;` - This method retrieves the value of a field from the object, which could be a source of the empty object issue.\n5. `org.apache.commons.lang3.builder.ReflectionToStringBuilder:accept(Ljava/lang/reflect/Field;)Z` - This method determines whether a field should be included in the string representation, which could affect the output.\n\nThese methods are critical in the process of generating the string representation of the object and are likely candidates for further investigation to identify the root cause of the test failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 31, 30]\n}\n```"
