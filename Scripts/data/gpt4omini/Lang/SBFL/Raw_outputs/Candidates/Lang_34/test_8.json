"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReflectionObjectCycle` is failing due to an assertion that expected a `null` value but received an empty object (`{}`). The failure occurs in the method `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry`, which is called after the assertion. This suggests that the issue may be related to how the `toString` method is implemented for the objects involved in the test.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ToStringBuilder` and `ReflectionToStringBuilder` classes, which are responsible for generating string representations of objects. The methods that are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further include:\n\n1. `reflectionToString(Object object)` - This method is the entry point for generating the string representation.\n2. `toString(Object object)` - This method is called within `reflectionToString` and is responsible for delegating to the appropriate method for string generation.\n3. `toString(Object object, ToStringStyle style, boolean outputTransients, boolean outputStatics)` - This method handles the actual string generation logic.\n4. `appendFieldsIn(Class<?> clazz)` - This method is responsible for appending fields of the class to the string representation.\n5. `getValue(Field field)` - This method retrieves the value of a field, which could be crucial if the field is not handled correctly.\n6. `accept(Field field)` - This method determines whether a field should be included in the string representation, which could lead to missing fields if not implemented correctly.\n\nThese methods are critical in understanding how the string representation is constructed and why it might not be returning the expected result.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 7, 31, 30]\n}\n```"
