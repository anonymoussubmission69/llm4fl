"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testObjectCycle` is failing due to an assertion that expected a `null` value but received an empty object representation (`{}`). The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method, which is likely related to how the `toString` method is implemented for the `ObjectCycle` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ToStringStyle` and `ToStringBuilder` classes, which are responsible for generating string representations of objects. The methods that are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further include:\n\n1. **`appendCyclicObject`**: This method is directly involved in handling cyclic references, which is relevant given that the test creates a cyclic reference between two `ObjectCycle` instances.\n2. **`identityToString`**: This method is called within `appendCyclicObject` and is responsible for converting an object to its string representation. If it does not handle nulls correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n3. **`getRegistry`**: This method retrieves the registry of objects, which may be relevant if the test is checking for registered objects.\n4. **`isRegistered`**: This method checks if an object is registered in the registry, which could affect how the `toString` method behaves.\n5. **`toString`**: The `toString` method in `ToStringBuilder` is crucial as it is the final method that generates the string representation of the object, and it directly influences the outcome of the test.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 11]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
