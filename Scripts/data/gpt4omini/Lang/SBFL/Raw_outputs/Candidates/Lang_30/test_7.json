"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAnyBut_StringStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because the expected value (2) does not match the actual value (3) returned by the method `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `indexOfAnyBut` method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`: This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the fault lies.\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty`: This method is called within `indexOfAnyBut` to check if the input strings are empty, which could also potentially lead to incorrect behavior if not handled properly.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut` - This is the primary method being tested and is expected to return the correct index based on the input strings.\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty` - This method is used to validate input and could affect the logic in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
