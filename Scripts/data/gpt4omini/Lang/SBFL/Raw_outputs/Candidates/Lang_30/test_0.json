"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAny_StringCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected a value of `2` but received `0`. This indicates that the method `indexOfAny` in the `StringUtils` class is likely not functioning as expected when handling supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `ArrayUtils:isEmpty(char[])`\n2. `StringUtils:indexOfAny(CharSequence, char[])`\n3. `StringUtils:isEmpty(CharSequence)`\n\n### Analysis of Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`StringUtils:indexOfAny(CharSequence, char[])`**: This method is directly involved in the test case and is responsible for finding the index of any character from the `searchChars` array in the `CharSequence`. The failure indicates that it may not be correctly handling the supplementary characters, which is the core of the test.\n\n2. **`StringUtils:isEmpty(CharSequence)`**: This method is called within `indexOfAny` to check if the `CharSequence` is empty. If it incorrectly identifies a non-empty sequence as empty, it could lead to the wrong index being returned.\n\n3. **`ArrayUtils:isEmpty(char[])`**: This method is also called within `indexOfAny` to check if the `searchChars` array is empty. If it incorrectly identifies a non-empty array as empty, it could also lead to the wrong index being returned.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe methods that need to be analyzed further to find the fault are primarily `StringUtils:indexOfAny`, but also `StringUtils:isEmpty` and `ArrayUtils:isEmpty` since they are involved in the logic that leads to the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 0]\n}\n```"
