"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAny_StringCharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `false` but received `true`. This indicates that the method being tested, `StringUtils.containsAny`, is likely not handling the input as expected, particularly with respect to supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[])`**: This method checks if a character array is empty or null. If it incorrectly returns `false` for an empty array, it could lead to unexpected behavior in `StringUtils.containsAny`.\n\n2. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence, char[])`**: This is the primary method under test. The logic within this method is crucial, especially how it handles characters, including supplementary characters. The failure suggests that it may not be correctly identifying the presence of characters.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence)`**: This method checks if a `CharSequence` is empty or null. If it incorrectly identifies a non-empty sequence as empty, it could affect the flow in `StringUtils.containsAny`.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the most suspicious methods to analyze further are `StringUtils.containsAny` and `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`, as they are directly involved in the logic that led to the assertion failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
