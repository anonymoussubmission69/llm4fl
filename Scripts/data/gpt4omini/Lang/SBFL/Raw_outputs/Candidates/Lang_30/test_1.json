"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAny_StringStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected a return value of `2` from the method `StringUtils.indexOfAny`, but it returned `0`. This indicates that the method is not correctly identifying the index of the character in the provided string.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[])` - This method checks if a character array is empty or null. It is indirectly involved since it is called within `StringUtils.indexOfAny`.\n2. `StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence, char[])` - This method is the primary method being tested and is likely where the fault lies.\n3. `StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence, String)` - This method is also involved as it calls the above method with a character array derived from a string.\n4. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence)` - This method checks if a `CharSequence` is empty or null and is used in the other methods.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the most suspicious methods to analyze further are:\n\n- `StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence, char[])` (method_id: 1) - This is the main method being tested and is likely where the issue is occurring.\n- `StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence, String)` (method_id: 2) - This method is responsible for converting the string to a character array and calling the other method, so it could also be a source of the problem.\n\nThe methods `ArrayUtils.isEmpty` and `StringUtils.isEmpty` are less likely to be the source of the fault, but they are still relevant as they are part of the control flow.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2]\n}\n```"
