"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testPrimitiveTypeClassSerialization` is failing due to a `SerializationException` caused by a `ClassNotFoundException` while reading cloned object data. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `clone` method of the `SerializationUtils` class.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to this failure include:\n\n1. **SerializationException Constructor** - This method is invoked when a `ClassNotFoundException` occurs during the cloning process.\n2. **ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream Constructor** - This method is part of the input stream setup for deserialization.\n3. **resolveClass** - This method attempts to resolve the class name during deserialization and could be the source of the `ClassNotFoundException`.\n4. **clone** - This is the method directly involved in the test and is where the exception is thrown.\n5. **serialize** - While this method is not directly involved in the failure, it is part of the serialization process that leads to the cloning.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `clone` (method_id: 3)\n- `resolveClass` (method_id: 2)\n- `SerializationException` constructor (method_id: 0)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3]\n}\n```"
