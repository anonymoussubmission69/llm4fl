"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testJavaVersionAsInt` is failing due to an assertion that expected a value of `0` but received `0.0`. This indicates a potential issue with the method `toJavaVersionInt` in the `SystemUtils` class, which is responsible for converting a Java version string into an integer representation.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `toJavaVersionInt(String version)`: This method is likely the primary suspect since it directly handles the input and output related to the test case.\n2. `toJavaVersionIntArray(String version, int limit)`: This method is called within `toJavaVersionInt` and processes the version string, so it could also be a source of the issue.\n3. `toVersionInt(int[] javaVersions)`: This method converts an array of integers into a single integer version. It may also contribute to the problem if the array is not being constructed correctly.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0 (`toJavaVersionInt`) is the most critical as it is directly involved in the test case.\n- Method ID 1 (`toJavaVersionIntArray`) is also important as it prepares the data for the main method.\n- Method ID 2 (`toVersionInt`) should be checked to ensure it correctly processes the integer array."
