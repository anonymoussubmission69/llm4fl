"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testEscapedQuote_LANG_477` is failing due to a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`. This indicates that the application is trying to allocate more memory than is available, which often occurs due to excessive string manipulation or recursion.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the error occurs in the `appendQuotedString` method of the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class, which is called during the execution of the `applyPattern` method. The `applyPattern` method is responsible for processing the pattern string, and it appears to be where the excessive memory usage is originating.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the error:\n\n1. **appendQuotedString**: This method is directly involved in appending strings and could be causing excessive memory usage if not handled properly.\n2. **applyPattern**: This method is responsible for applying the pattern and calls `appendQuotedString`, making it a key method to analyze for potential issues.\n3. **ExtendedMessageFormat constructor**: The constructor initializes the object and calls `applyPattern`, which could also contribute to the problem if the pattern is not managed correctly.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 4]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0: `appendQuotedString`\n- Method ID 3: `ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor\n- Method ID 4: `applyPattern`"
