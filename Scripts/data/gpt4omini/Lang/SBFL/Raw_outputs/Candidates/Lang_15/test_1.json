"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testGetTypeArguments` is failing due to an assertion that expected a size of 2 but received 0. This indicates that the method responsible for retrieving type arguments is likely not functioning as expected.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`getTypeArguments(Type type, Class<?> toClass)`** - This method is directly involved in retrieving type arguments based on the provided type and class. It is crucial to analyze how it processes the input and why it might return an empty map.\n\n2. **`getTypeArguments(Class<?> cls, Class<?> toClass)`** - This method is a variant that deals specifically with class types. It may have logic that leads to the failure if the class types are not being handled correctly.\n\n3. **`isAssignable(Type type, Type toType)`** - This method checks if one type is assignable to another. If the type checking logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect type argument retrieval.\n\n4. **`isAssignable(Type type, Class<?> toClass)`** - Similar to the previous method, this one checks assignability between a type and a class. Any issues here could also affect the results of type argument retrieval.\n\n5. **`getTypeArguments(ParameterizedType parameterizedType, Class<?> toClass)`** - This method handles parameterized types specifically. If the parameterized type is not being processed correctly, it could lead to the empty result.\n\n6. **`getClosestParentType(Class<?> cls, Class<?> superClass)`** - This method is used to find the closest parent type. If it fails to identify the correct parent type, it could affect the type argument resolution.\n\n7. **`getRawType(ParameterizedType parameterizedType)`** - This method retrieves the raw type from a parameterized type. If it does not return the expected class, it could lead to issues in type argument resolution.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
