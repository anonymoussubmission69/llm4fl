"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testReducedFactory_int_int()` is designed to test the `getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)` method of the `Fraction` class. The test checks various scenarios including zero, normal fractions, improper fractions, negative fractions, and edge cases like zero denominators.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that there was an `AssertionFailedError` due to an expected value of `-1073741824` but the actual value returned was `-2147483648`. This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with how the `getReducedFraction` method handles certain inputs, particularly with negative values and edge cases involving `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.\n\n3. The methods that are covered by the failed test include:\n   - `greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)`: This method is likely involved in reducing the fraction and could be a source of error if it does not handle edge cases correctly.\n   - `getNumerator()`: This method simply returns the numerator and is less likely to be the source of the error.\n   - `getDenominator()`: Similar to `getNumerator()`, this method returns the denominator and is also less likely to be the source of the error.\n   - The constructor `Fraction(int numerator, int denominator)`: This method initializes the fraction and could potentially be involved if there are issues with how the fraction is created.\n   - `getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)`: This is the primary method under test and is the most suspicious as it directly relates to the failure.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 4]\n}\n```\n\n- Method ID 0: `greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)` - Potential issues in handling edge cases.\n- Method ID 4: `getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)` - Directly related to the failure and needs thorough examination."
