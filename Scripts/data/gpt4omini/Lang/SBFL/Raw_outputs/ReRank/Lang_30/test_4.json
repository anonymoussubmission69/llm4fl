"The method `containsNone` is responsible for checking if a `CharSequence` contains none of the characters in the `invalidChars` string. The test failure indicates that it is not correctly handling supplementary characters, which are crucial in this context. \n\n### Analysis of the Method\nThe method starts by checking if either `cs` (the character sequence) or `invalidChars` is null. If either is null, it calls another overloaded version of `containsNone` that takes a character array. However, the method does not seem to handle the actual character checking logic in the provided snippet, which is likely where the issue lies.\n\n### Potential Fix\nTo fix the method, we need to ensure that it correctly checks for supplementary characters. Supplementary characters in Java are represented using two `char` values (a surrogate pair). The method should iterate through the `CharSequence` and check each character against the `invalidChars`, taking care to handle surrogate pairs properly.\n\nHere\u2019s a potential fix for the method:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars) {\n    if (cs == null || invalidChars == null) {\n        return containsNone(cs, invalidChars.toCharArray());\n    }\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < cs.length(); i++) {\n        char c = cs.charAt(i);\n        if (invalidChars.indexOf(c) >= 0) {\n            return false; // Found a character that is in invalidChars\n        }\n        // Check for supplementary characters\n        if (Character.isHighSurrogate(c) && i + 1 < cs.length()) {\n            char next = cs.charAt(i + 1);\n            if (Character.isLowSurrogate(next) && invalidChars.indexOf(Character.toCodePoint(c, next)) >= 0) {\n                return false; // Found a supplementary character in invalidChars\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return true; // No characters from invalidChars found\n}\n```\n\n### Re-Ranking\nGiven that the method `containsNone` is the only method analyzed and it is responsible for the test failure, it remains the most suspicious method.\n\n### Output\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
