"Based on the analysis of the test case and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings and potential fixes for the methods:\n\n### Method Analysis\n\n1. **Method ID 0: `containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**\n   - **Issues Identified:**\n     - The method does not handle null checks correctly. If `cs` or `searchChars` is null, it should return true or false appropriately instead of proceeding to check lengths.\n     - The return statement for `true` is incorrectly placed inside the loop, which means it will never be reached if the first character matches.\n   - **Potential Fix:**\n     ```java\n     public static boolean containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {\n         if (cs == null || searchChars == null) {\n             return true; // or false based on desired behavior\n         }\n         int csLen = cs.length();\n         int searchLen = searchChars.length;\n         for (int i = 0; i < csLen; i++) {\n             char ch = cs.charAt(i);\n             for (int j = 0; j < searchLen; j++) {\n                 if (searchChars[j] == ch) {\n                     return false;\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n         return true; // This should be outside the loop\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Method ID 1: `containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`**\n   - **Issues Identified:**\n     - This method does handle null checks but relies on the first method's implementation. If the first method has issues, this method will also be affected.\n   - **Potential Fix:**\n     ```java\n     public static boolean containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars) {\n         if (cs == null || invalidChars == null) {\n             return true; // or false based on desired behavior\n         }\n         return containsNone(cs, invalidChars.toCharArray());\n     }\n     ```\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods\nAfter analyzing the methods and their issues, the re-ranking of suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n- **Method ID 0** is still the most suspicious due to its flawed logic and handling of null cases.\n- **Method ID 1** is less suspicious as it has proper null checks, but it still relies on the first method.\n\n### Final Output\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
