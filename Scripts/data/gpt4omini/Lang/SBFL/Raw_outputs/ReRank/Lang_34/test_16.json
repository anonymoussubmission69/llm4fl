"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method ID 2 (`reflectionAppendArrayDetail`)**: This method is responsible for appending array details to a buffer. It does not handle the case where the entire array is null correctly, which could lead to the empty representation observed in the test failure. The method should check if the array is null before attempting to get its length or iterate over it.\n\n2. **Method ID 3 (`reflectionAppendArray`)**: This method calls `reflectionAppendArrayDetail`. If the array is null and not handled properly, it could contribute to the failure. It should include a check for null before calling the detail method.\n\n3. **Method ID 1 (`toString`)**: This method calls another overloaded `toString` method. If that method does not handle null values or arrays correctly, it could be a source of the issue. It should ensure that it can handle null objects gracefully.\n\n4. **Method ID 0 (`reflectionToString`)**: This method delegates to `ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString(object)`. If that method does not handle null arrays correctly, it could lead to the observed failure. It should also check for null before proceeding.\n\n5. **Method ID 30 (`appendNullText`)**: This method appends a null text representation to the buffer. If it is not called when the array is null, it could lead to the empty representation issue, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the failure. It is less suspicious compared to the others.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **Method ID 2**: Add a null check for the array before proceeding with appending details.\n- **Method ID 3**: Add a null check for the array before calling `reflectionAppendArrayDetail`.\n- **Method ID 1**: Ensure that the overloaded `toString` method can handle null values appropriately.\n- **Method ID 0**: Ensure that `reflectionToString` can handle null objects gracefully.\n- **Method ID 30**: Ensure that this method is called when the array is null, but it is less critical compared to the others.\n\n### ReRanked Methods:\n1.
