"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the failure seems to be related to the handling of cyclic references in arrays. The test is expecting a specific string representation of cyclic arrays, but it is returning an empty representation instead. \n\n### Method Analysis:\n1. **Method ID 2 (`reflectionAppendArray`)**: This method is responsible for appending array details. It directly interacts with the array and is crucial for handling cyclic references. If it does not handle cyclic references properly, it could lead to incorrect string representations. **(Rank 1)**\n\n2. **Method ID 9 (`appendFieldsIn`)**: This method checks if the class is an array and calls the method that appends array details. If it fails to handle cyclic references, it could contribute to the failure. **(Rank 2)**\n\n3. **Method ID 12 (`appendCyclicObject`)**: This method is responsible for handling cyclic objects. If it does not correctly identify cyclic references, it could lead to the empty representation observed in the test. **(Rank 3)**\n\n4. **Method ID 0 (`reflectionToString`)**: This method delegates to another method for string representation. If the underlying method does not handle cyclic references correctly, it could be a source of the issue. **(Rank 4)**\n\n5. **Method ID 1 (`toString`)**: This method calls another `toString` method with additional parameters. While it could be involved, it seems less directly related to the cyclic array issue than the others. **(Rank 5)**\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **Method ID 2 (`reflectionAppendArray`)**: Ensure that the method checks for cyclic references before appending array details. Implement a mechanism to track already visited objects to prevent infinite loops.\n\n- **Method ID 9 (`appendFieldsIn`)**: Add a check to handle cyclic references when calling `reflectionAppendArray`. Ensure that it does not call the append method if the object has already been processed.\n\n- **Method ID 12 (`appendCyclicObject`)**: Modify this method to include logic that checks if the object has already been appended. If it has, return a placeholder or a specific string indicating a cyclic reference.\n\n- **Method ID 0 (`reflectionToString`)**: Ensure that the method correctly handles the case where cyclic references are detected by delegating to a method that can manage such cases.\n\n- **Method ID 1 (`toString`)**: Review the parameters being passed to ensure they are appropriate for handling cyclic references. If necessary, add additional checks.\n\n### ReRanked Methods:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
