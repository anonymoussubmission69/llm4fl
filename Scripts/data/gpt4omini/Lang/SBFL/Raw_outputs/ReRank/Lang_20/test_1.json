"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method 1 (`join(Object[] array, char separator, int startIndex, int endIndex)`)**:\n   - The method checks if `array` is null but continues to execute code that assumes `array` is not null. This leads to a `NullPointerException` when trying to access `array[startIndex]`.\n   - The fix should involve returning an appropriate value (like null or an empty string) when `array` is null, instead of proceeding with calculations.\n\n2. **Method 0 (`join(Object[] array, char separator)`)**:\n   - This method correctly checks if `array` is null and returns null, which is the expected behavior. However, it does not reach the join logic due to the early return.\n   - While it is not causing the test failure, it is less suspicious compared to method 1.\n\n### Proposed Fixes:\n- **For Method 1**:\n  ```java\n  public static String join(Object[] array, char separator, int startIndex, int endIndex) {\n      if (array == null) {\n          return null; // or throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Array cannot be null\");\n      }\n      int noOfItems = (endIndex - startIndex);\n      if (noOfItems <= 0) {\n          return \"\"; // Return empty string if no items to join\n      }\n      StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder((array[startIndex] == null ? 16 : array[startIndex].toString().length()) + 1);\n      for (int i = startIndex; i < endIndex; i++) {\n          if (i > startIndex) {\n              buf.append(separator);\n          }\n          if (array[i] != null) {\n              buf.append(array[i]);\n          }\n      }\n      return buf.toString();\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **For Method 0**:\n  - No changes are necessary as it is functioning correctly.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\nAfter analyzing the methods and their potential fixes, the ranking of suspiciousness should be updated as follows:\n- Method 1 is still the most suspicious due to the potential for a `NullPointerException`.\n- Method 0 is less suspicious as it handles null arrays correctly.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
