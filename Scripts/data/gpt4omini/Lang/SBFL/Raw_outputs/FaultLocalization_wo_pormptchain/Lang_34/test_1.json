"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString' is directly involved in converting the object to a string representation. The failure indicates that it returned an unexpected result ('{}' instead of '<null>'). This suggests that the method may not be handling null values correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for calling the actual string conversion logic. If 'reflectionToString' is failing, this method could also be implicated as it orchestrates the call to 'reflectionToString'.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail' is responsible for appending details of an array to the string representation. If the array handling is incorrect, it could lead to the unexpected output seen in the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArray' is called to append array details. If there is an issue with how arrays are processed, this method could be a contributing factor to the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
