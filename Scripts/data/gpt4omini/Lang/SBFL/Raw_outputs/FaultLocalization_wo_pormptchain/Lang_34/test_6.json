"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString' calls 'ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString(object)', which is responsible for converting the object to a string representation. The failure indicates that the expected output was <null> but the actual output was '{}', suggesting that this method may not be handling null values correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' calls another overloaded 'toString' method. If the handling of null values is incorrect in the subsequent calls, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendFieldsIn' checks if the class is an array and calls 'reflectionAppendArray'. If the array handling is incorrect, it could lead to the failure when trying to convert the array to a string representation.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' checks if the object is null and attempts to append fields. If the object is null, it may not be handling this case properly, leading to the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
