"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString' calls 'ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString(object)', which is responsible for converting the object to a string representation. Since the test fails on the assertion related to the string representation, this method is highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for delegating the call to another 'toString' method with additional parameters. It is directly involved in the string conversion process, making it suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendFieldsIn' checks if the class is an array and calls 'reflectionAppendArray'. Given that the test involves a 2D array, this method is likely involved in the faulty behavior.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail' is responsible for appending details of an array to a StringBuffer. Since the test involves a complex array structure, this method could be contributing to the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
