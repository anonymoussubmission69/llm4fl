"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString(Object object)' is directly called in the test and is responsible for converting the object to a string representation. The failure indicates that the expected output was null, but the actual output was an empty map, suggesting a potential issue in how the object is being processed.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString(Object object)' calls 'reflectionToString' and is part of the chain that leads to the failure. If there is an issue in how the object is passed or processed, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString(Object object, ToStringStyle style, boolean outputTransients, boolean outputStatics, Class<?> reflectUpToClass)' is responsible for handling the object with specific styles and settings.
