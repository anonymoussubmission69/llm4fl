"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString(Object object)' calls another method to convert the object to a string representation. If the object is null, it may not handle it correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString(Object object)' is responsible for invoking the reflection logic. If it does not handle null objects properly, it could lead to the test failure observed.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArray(Object array)' is called to append array details. If the array is null, it may not handle it correctly, which could lead to the assertion failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail(StringBuffer buffer, String fieldName, Object array)' is responsible for appending details of the array. If the array is null, it may not append correctly, causing the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
