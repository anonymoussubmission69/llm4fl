"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString(Object object)' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for converting an object to its string representation. Since the test fails when asserting the string representation of a boolean array, this method is highly suspicious as it directly handles the conversion of the object.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString(Object object)' in 'ToStringBuilder' calls 'ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString(object)'. This method acts as a wrapper and is directly involved in the process of converting the object to a string, making it suspicious as well.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArray(Object array)' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for appending the details of an array to the string representation. Given that the test involves a boolean array, this method is likely involved in the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendFieldsIn(Class<?> clazz)' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for appending fields of a class to the string representation. If the boolean array is treated as an object, this method may also be involved in the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
