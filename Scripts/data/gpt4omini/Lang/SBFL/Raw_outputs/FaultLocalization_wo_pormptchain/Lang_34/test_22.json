"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString()' in 'ToStringBuilder' is responsible for generating the string representation of the object.

This suggests that the logic in this method may not be handling null values correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString(Object object)' in 'ToStringBuilder' calls 'ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString(object)'.
