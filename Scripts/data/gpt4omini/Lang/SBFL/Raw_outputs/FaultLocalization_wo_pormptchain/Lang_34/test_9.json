"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString' is directly involved in converting an object to its string representation. The test failure indicates that the expected output was '<null>' but the actual output was '{}', suggesting that this method may not be handling null values correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for calling the core logic to convert an object to a string. If 'reflectionToString' fails, this method will also be implicated as it is the entry point for the conversion process.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail' is responsible for appending details of an array to the string representation. Since the test involves an array, this method could be failing to handle null arrays properly.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArray' is called to append array details. If there are issues with how arrays are processed, this method could be a contributing factor to the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
