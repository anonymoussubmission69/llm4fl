"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString' is directly involved in converting the object to a string representation. The failure indicates that it returned an unexpected result ('{}' instead of '<null>'). This suggests that the method may not be handling null arrays correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for calling the actual string conversion logic. If 'reflectionToString' fails, this method is likely to be implicated as it orchestrates the call to it.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail' is responsible for appending details of an array to the string buffer. Since the test involves a double array, this method's logic for handling nulls and NaN values could be faulty.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArray' calls 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail'. If there is an issue with how arrays are processed, this method could also be a contributing factor.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 30,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendNullText' is responsible for appending a specific text when a null value is encountered. If this method does not handle nulls correctly, it could lead to the unexpected output seen in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
