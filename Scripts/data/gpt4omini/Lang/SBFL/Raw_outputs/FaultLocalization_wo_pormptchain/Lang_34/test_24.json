"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString' is directly called in the test and is responsible for converting the object to a string representation. The failure indicates that the expected output was null, but the actual output was an empty string '{}'. This suggests that the method may not be handling cyclic references correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is called by 'reflectionToString'. It is responsible for delegating the string conversion process. If there is an issue in how it handles the object or its properties, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendFieldsIn' is responsible for appending fields of the class to the string representation. If it does not handle arrays or cyclic references properly, it could lead to incorrect output.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' that takes multiple parameters is responsible for creating a new instance of 'ReflectionToStringBuilder'. If the parameters are not set correctly, it could affect the output.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
