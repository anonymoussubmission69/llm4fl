"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString' calls 'ReflectionToStringBuilder.toString', which is responsible for converting the object to a string representation. The failure indicates that the expected output was <null>, but the actual output was '{}', suggesting that this method may not be handling null arrays correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for delegating the call to another 'toString' method with additional parameters. If the parameters are not handled correctly, it could lead to incorrect string representations, especially for null values.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendFieldsIn' checks if the class is an array and calls 'reflectionAppendArray'. If the handling of arrays is incorrect, it could lead to issues when trying to represent null arrays.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 12,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' checks if the object is null and attempts to append fields. If the object is null, it may not handle the case correctly, leading to unexpected results.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
