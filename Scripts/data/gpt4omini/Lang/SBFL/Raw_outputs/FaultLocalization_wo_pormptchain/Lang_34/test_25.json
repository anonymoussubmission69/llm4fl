"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionToString' is directly involved in converting the object to a string representation. The failure indicates that it returned an unexpected result ('{}' instead of '<null>'). This suggests that the method may not be handling null arrays correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for calling the actual string conversion logic. If the input is not handled properly, it could lead to incorrect outputs, as seen in the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail' is responsible for appending details of an array to the string buffer. If it does not handle null values correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendFieldsIn' checks if the class is an array and calls 'reflectionAppendArray'. If the logic for handling arrays is flawed, it could contribute to the failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the string conversion process and their potential to mishandle null values, which is the root cause of the test failure."
