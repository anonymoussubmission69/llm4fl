"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'deleteImpl' method is responsible for modifying the internal buffer of the StrBuilder. The stack trace indicates that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurred during a call to System.arraycopy, which suggests that the indices being used in this method may be incorrect, leading to an attempt to access an invalid index in the buffer.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'deleteAll' method calls 'deleteImpl' and is responsible for determining the indices to delete from the buffer.
