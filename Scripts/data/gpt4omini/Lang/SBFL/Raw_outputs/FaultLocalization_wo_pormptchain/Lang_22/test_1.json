"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getReducedFraction' is responsible for reducing fractions and handling edge cases such as zero denominators and integer overflow. The test case that failed indicates an issue with the expected output of this method, particularly when dealing with extreme values like Integer.MIN_VALUE. This suggests that there may be a fault in how the method processes these values.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'greatestCommonDivisor' method is called within 'getReducedFraction' to simplify the fraction. If there is an error in calculating the GCD, it could lead to incorrect results in the reduced fraction. Given that the test case failed on a fraction reduction, this method is also suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getNumerator' method simply returns the numerator of the fraction. While it is less likely to be the source of the fault, if the numerator was incorrectly set during the fraction creation or reduction process, it could contribute to the failure.
