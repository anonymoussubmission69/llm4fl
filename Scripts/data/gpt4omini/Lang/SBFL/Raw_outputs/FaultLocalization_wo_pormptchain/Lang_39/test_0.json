"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'replaceEach' is responsible for replacing occurrences of substrings in a given text. The stack trace indicates a NullPointerException occurring within this method, suggesting that it does not handle null values properly, especially when the searchList or replacementList contains null elements. This is critical since the test cases are specifically designed to check for null safety.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The overloaded 'replaceEach' method is a public static method that calls the private version of 'replaceEach'. While it is less suspicious than the private method, it still plays a role in the failure since it does not perform any null checks before delegating to the private method. If the input parameters are null, it could lead to the same NullPointerException.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
