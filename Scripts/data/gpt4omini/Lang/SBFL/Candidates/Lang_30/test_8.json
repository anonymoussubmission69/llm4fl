    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_CharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing because it expected a `true` result from the `StringUtils.containsNone` method but received `false`. This indicates that the method is not functioning as expected when handling the specific edge case of supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered method that is suspicious and needs further analysis is:\n\n1. `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils:containsNone(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;[C)Z` - This method is responsible for checking if none of the characters in the `searchChars` array are present in the `CharSequence`. Given that the test is failing on this method, it is crucial to investigate its implementation, especially how it handles edge cases like supplementary characters.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
