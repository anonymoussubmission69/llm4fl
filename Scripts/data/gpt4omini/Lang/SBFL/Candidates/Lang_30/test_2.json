    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAny_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `false` but received `true`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsAny` is likely not handling the edge case of supplementary characters correctly.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[])` - This method checks if an array is empty or null. It is indirectly involved since it is called within `StringUtils.containsAny`.\n2. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence, char[])` - This is the primary method under test and is directly responsible for the failure.\n3. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence)` - This method checks if a `CharSequence` is empty or null. It is also indirectly involved as it is called within `StringUtils.containsAny`.\n4. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence, String)` - This method is an overload of `containsAny` and may also be relevant if it is called in other contexts.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the most suspicious methods to analyze further are `StringUtils.containsAny` and `StringUtils.isEmpty`, as they are directly involved in the logic that led to the assertion failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2]\n}\n```"
