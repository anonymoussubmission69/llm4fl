    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates that the method being tested, `StringUtils.containsNone`, is likely not functioning as expected when handling certain characters, specifically supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`\n2. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`\n\nBoth methods are responsible for checking if a given character sequence contains any characters from a specified set. The failure suggests that there may be an issue with how these methods handle edge cases, particularly with supplementary characters.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**: This method directly checks if any character in `searchChars` is present in `cs`. The logic may not be correctly handling the edge cases involving supplementary characters.\n2. **`StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`**: This method converts a string of invalid characters to a character array and calls the first method. If the conversion or the subsequent call to the first method has issues, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
