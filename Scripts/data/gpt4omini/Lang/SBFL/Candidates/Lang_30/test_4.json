    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_StringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsNone` is likely not functioning as expected when dealing with supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered method identified is:\n- `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`\n\nThis method is responsible for checking if the `CharSequence` contains none of the characters specified in `invalidChars`. Given that the test is specifically checking for cases involving supplementary characters, this method is suspicious and should be analyzed further to understand why it is returning `false` when it should return `true`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n``` \n\nThis indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsNone` (method_id: 0) is the primary suspect for the fault in the test. Further investigation into its implementation, especially regarding how it handles supplementary characters, is warranted."
