    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because it expected `false` but received `true` from the `StringUtils.containsAny` method. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the `containsAny` method is determining if any characters from the search array are present in the given character sequence.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for checking if any character from the `searchChars` array is present in the `cs` sequence. The logic here needs to be scrutinized to understand why it returned `true` when it should have returned `false`.\n\n2. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`** - This method is a wrapper that converts a `String` to a `char[]` and calls the first `containsAny` method. If the input `searchChars` is not handled correctly, it could lead to unexpected results.\n\n3. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`** - This method checks if the `searchChars` array is empty. If it incorrectly identifies an empty array, it could affect the outcome of the `containsAny` method.\n\n4. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`** - This method checks if the character sequence is empty. If it incorrectly identifies the character sequence as empty, it could also lead to unexpected behavior in the `containsAny` method.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
