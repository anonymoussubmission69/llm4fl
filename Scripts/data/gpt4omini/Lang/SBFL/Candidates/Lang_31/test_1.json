    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because it expected `false` but received `true` from the `StringUtils.containsAny` method. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the `containsAny` method is determining if any characters from the `searchChars` array are present in the `CharSequence`.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**: This is the primary method being tested. The logic within this method is crucial to understanding why it returned `true` when it should have returned `false`.\n\n2. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`**: This method checks if the `searchChars` array is empty. If it incorrectly identifies the array as non-empty, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the `containsAny` method.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`**: This method checks if the `CharSequence` is empty. If it incorrectly identifies the `CharSequence` as non-empty, it could also lead to unexpected behavior in the `containsAny` method.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the failure of the test, with `StringUtils.containsAny` being the most critical to analyze first, followed by the utility methods that check for emptiness."
