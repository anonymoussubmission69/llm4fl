The test `testReflectionIntArrayArray` is designed to test the behavior of the `ToStringBuilder` class when handling arrays, particularly with null values.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an assertion failed because the expected output was `<null>`, but the actual output was `{}`. This suggests that the method responsible for converting the array to a string representation did not handle the null value correctly.\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include several methods from the `ToStringStyle` and `ReflectionToStringBuilder` classes, which are responsible for appending details of objects and arrays to a string buffer.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail`**: This method is responsible for appending details of an array to a string buffer. It includes logic for handling null items in the array, which is directly related to the failure observed in the test.\n- **`appendDetail`**: This method handles the appending of details for integer arrays. It may not be handling null values correctly, leading to the unexpected output.\n- **`reflectionAppendArray`**: This method calls `reflectionAppendArrayDetail`, and any issues in the latter would propagate back to this method.\n- **`appendFieldsIn`**: This method checks if the class is an array and calls `reflectionAppendArray`, making it relevant to the flow of execution.\n- **`toString`**: This method is the entry point for converting an object to a string representation and may also be involved in the failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 13]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
