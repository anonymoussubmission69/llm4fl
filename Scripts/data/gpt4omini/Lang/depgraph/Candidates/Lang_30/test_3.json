    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsNone` is likely not functioning as expected when handling certain characters, specifically supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`\n2. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`\n\nBoth methods are suspicious because they are directly involved in the assertion that is failing. The first method checks if none of the characters in `searchChars` are present in the `CharSequence cs`, while the second method converts a `String` to a `char[]` and calls the first method. The failure could be due to how these methods handle edge cases, particularly with supplementary characters.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
