    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAnyBut_StringStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because the expected value (2) does not match the actual value (3) returned by the method `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `indexOfAnyBut` method.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the `assertEquals` method, which compares the expected and actual values. The `indexOfAnyBut` method is responsible for determining the index of the first character in the string that is not present in the `searchChars` string. \n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`: This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the fault lies.\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty`: This method is called within `indexOfAnyBut` to check if either the input string or the search characters are empty.\n\nGiven that the failure is related to the logic of finding the index of characters, the `indexOfAnyBut` method is the primary suspect. The `isEmpty` method, while less likely to be the source of the fault, is still relevant as it affects the flow of the `indexOfAnyBut` method.\n\nThus, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut` (method_id: 0)\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty` (method_id: 1)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
