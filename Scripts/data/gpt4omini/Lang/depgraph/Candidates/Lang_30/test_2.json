    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAny_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `false` but received `true`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsAny` is likely not functioning as expected when handling supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for checking if any character from `searchChars` is present in `cs`. The logic within this method, especially around handling characters, needs to be scrutinized.\n\n2. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`**: This method calls the first method with a character array. It is important to check how it handles the conversion from `String` to `char[]` and if it correctly passes the supplementary characters.\n\n3. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`**: This method checks if the character array is empty. While it may not seem directly related to the failure, it is part of the logic flow in `containsAny` and should be verified to ensure it behaves correctly.\n\n4. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`**: Similar to `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`, this method checks if the `CharSequence` is empty. It is also part of the logic in `containsAny` and should be checked for correctness.\n\nGiven the context of the failure and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods that need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n```"
