    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The `OutOfMemoryError` is occurring during the execution of the `appendQuotedString` method, which is called from the `applyPattern` method. This indicates that the issue is likely related to how strings are being handled in these methods.\n\n2. The `applyPattern` method contains a loop that processes each character of the pattern string. If the loop does not terminate correctly, it could lead to excessive memory allocation.\n\n3. The `appendQuotedString` method is responsible for handling quoted strings and could potentially lead to infinite recursion or excessive memory usage if not implemented correctly.\n\n4. The constructor of `ExtendedMessageFormat` calls `applyPattern`, but it is less likely to be the direct cause of the memory issue compared to the methods that handle the pattern parsing.\n\n5. The second constructor simply delegates to another constructor and does not contain any logic that could lead to excessive memory usage.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- **For `applyPattern`:** Ensure that the loop terminates correctly and that there are checks in place to prevent excessive memory allocation. For example, limit the number of iterations or add a condition to break out of the loop if a certain condition is met.\n\n- **For `appendQuotedString`:** Review the logic for handling quoted strings to ensure that it does not lead to infinite recursion. Implement checks to prevent excessive appending to the `StringBuffer`.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 1 (`appendQuotedString`)** - Most suspicious due to the direct involvement in the `OutOfMemoryError`.\n2. **Method ID 0 (`applyPattern`)** - Second most suspicious as it contains the loop that processes the pattern.\n3. **Method ID 2 (Constructor of `ExtendedMessageFormat`)** - Less suspicious as it primarily calls `applyPattern`.\n4. **Method ID 3 (Constructor of `ExtendedMessageFormat`)** - Least suspicious as it simply delegates to another constructor.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
