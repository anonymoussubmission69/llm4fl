"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test is designed to validate the `replaceEach` method from the `StringUtils` class. The stack trace indicates a `NullPointerException` occurring in the `replaceEach` method, specifically when handling null values in the `searchList` or `replacementList` arrays.\n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **Method ID 0**: This method is the core implementation of `replaceEach`. It checks for null or empty strings and handles the replacement logic. However, it does not adequately handle cases where `searchList` or `replacementList` contains null values, which is likely the cause of the `NullPointerException` observed in the test. The method's logic appears to be incomplete, as it does not return a valid result when encountering nulls in the input arrays.\n\n2. **Method ID 1**: This method is a simple wrapper that calls the first method with default parameters. It does not contain any logic that could lead to a `NullPointerException` itself, as it merely delegates to the more complex method.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\nGiven the analysis, the method that is most suspicious is the one that directly handles the replacement logic and is responsible for the exception.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method directly implements the replacement logic but fails to handle null values in the searchList and replacementList, leading to a NullPointerException. This is the most suspicious method as it is the source of the error.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method simply calls the more complex replaceEach method with default parameters. It does not contain any logic that could lead to a NullPointerException, making it less suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
