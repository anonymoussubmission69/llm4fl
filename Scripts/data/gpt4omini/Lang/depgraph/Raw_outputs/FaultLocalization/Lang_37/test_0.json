The test case indicates that an ArrayStoreException occurred when trying to add a Long to an Integer array, which suggests that the method does not properly handle type safety when combining arrays of different types. This is a critical issue since the test expected an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown, but instead, it resulted in an ArrayStoreException. This indicates a flaw in the method's implementation regarding type checks.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    }\n]\n```"
