"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testLang882` is failing due to an assertion that checks the result of the `translate` method in the `LookupTranslator` class. The expected result is `3`, but the actual result is `0`. This indicates that the method is not processing the input as expected.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `LookupTranslator` constructor: This method initializes the `lookupMap` and sets the shortest and longest lengths for the sequences.\n2. `translate` method: This method is responsible for translating the input based on the lookup map.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`LookupTranslator` constructor**: If the lookup map is not initialized correctly, it could lead to the `translate` method returning an incorrect result.\n2. **`translate` method**: This method directly affects the output of the test. If the logic for finding the substring or retrieving the result from the lookup map is flawed, it would cause the test to fail.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are crucial for the functionality being tested. The constructor sets up the necessary data for translation, and the `translate` method performs the actual translation logic. Therefore, both methods should be analyzed further to identify the fault.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
