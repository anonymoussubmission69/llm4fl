"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReflectionBooleanArrayArray` is failing due to an assertion that expected a null value but received an empty object representation instead. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method, which is called after the assertion checks.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ToStringStyle` and `ReflectionToStringBuilder` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`appendInternal`**: This method handles the appending of various object types to a `StringBuffer`. It includes logic for handling arrays, which is relevant since the test involves a boolean array.\n2. **`appendDetail`**: This method is responsible for appending details of boolean arrays. It could be a point of failure if it does not handle null values correctly.\n3. **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail`**: This method appends details of an array using reflection. It also checks for null values and could be involved in the failure.\n4. **`appendNullText`**: This method appends a specific text when a null value is encountered. If this is not functioning correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n5. **`isRegistered`**: This method checks if an object is already registered. If the registration logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect behavior when handling nulls.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 17, 18]\n}\n```"
