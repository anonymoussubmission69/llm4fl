"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReflectionHierarchy` is failing due to an assertion that expected a `null` value but received an empty object (`{}`). The failure occurs in the method `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` of the `ToStringBuilderTest` class.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to this failure include various methods from the `ReflectionToStringBuilder` and `ToStringStyle` classes. The methods that are most likely to be suspicious and warrant further investigation are:\n\n1. **`ReflectionToStringBuilder:toString()`** - This method is responsible for generating the string representation of an object, and it checks if the object is null.\n2. **`ReflectionToStringBuilder:appendFieldsIn(Class<?>)`** - This method appends fields of the given class to the string representation, which could be related to how fields are being processed.\n3. **`ToStringStyle:removeLastFieldSeparator(StringBuffer)`** - This method is involved in formatting the output and could affect the final string representation.\n4. **`ToStringStyle:append(StringBuffer, String, Object, Boolean)`** - This method appends a field to the string representation and could be involved in how null values are handled.\n5. **`ToStringStyle:appendEnd(StringBuffer, Object)`** - This method finalizes the string representation and could also be related to the handling of null values.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 0, 3, 8, 13]\n}\n```"
