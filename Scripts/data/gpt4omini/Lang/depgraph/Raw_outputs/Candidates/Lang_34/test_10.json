"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReflectionBooleanArray` is failing because it expected a null value but received an empty object representation (`{}`). The failure occurs in the method `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry`, which is called after the assertion that checks for null.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure is related to the handling of null values in the `ToStringBuilder` class, particularly in the methods that deal with reflection and array handling.\n\nThe covered methods that are potentially suspicious and need further analysis are:\n\n1. **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail`** - This method is responsible for appending details of an array to a `StringBuffer`. It handles null values and may not be correctly appending them.\n2. **`appendFieldsIn`** - This method checks if the class is an array and calls `reflectionAppendArray`. It may not be handling null arrays properly.\n3. **`toString`** - This method checks if the object is null and calls `appendFieldsIn`. If the object is null, it may not be handling the output correctly.\n4. **`reflectionAppendArray`** - This method calls `reflectionAppendArrayDetail` and may be involved in how arrays are processed.\n5. **`appendEnd`** - This method is responsible for appending the end of the string representation and unregistering the object. It may not be handling the end of the string correctly when the object is null.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 12, 11]\n}\n```"
