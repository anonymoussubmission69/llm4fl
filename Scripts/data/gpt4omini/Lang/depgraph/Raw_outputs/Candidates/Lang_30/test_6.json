"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAnyBut_StringCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected a value of `2` but received `3`. This indicates that the method `indexOfAnyBut` in the `StringUtils` class is likely not returning the expected index.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **`indexOfAnyBut`**: This is the primary method being tested. The failure in the test suggests that there may be a logic error in how this method processes the input `CharSequence` and `char[]`.\n\n2. **`isEmpty` (for `char[]`)**: This method checks if the provided character array is empty. If this method incorrectly identifies a non-empty array as empty, it could lead to unexpected behavior in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n\n3. **`isEmpty` (for `CharSequence`)**: Similar to the previous method, if this method incorrectly identifies a non-empty `CharSequence` as empty, it could also affect the logic in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure and the methods involved, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `indexOfAnyBut` (method_id: 0)\n- `isEmpty` for `char[]` (method_id: 1)\n- `isEmpty` for `CharSequence` (method_id: 2)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
