"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_StringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsNone` is likely not functioning as expected when handling supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered method identified is:\n- `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`\n\nThis method is responsible for checking if the `CharSequence` does not contain any characters from the `invalidChars` string. Given that the test is specifically checking for cases involving supplementary characters, this method is suspicious and should be analyzed further.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The potential suspicious method's ids\n}\n```"
