"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAny_StringStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected a value of `2` but received `0`. This indicates that the method `indexOfAny` is not returning the expected index for the character search.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to this failure are:\n\n1. **`indexOfAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for finding the index of any character from the `searchChars` array in the `cs` sequence. Since the test is failing here, this method is highly suspicious.\n\n2. **`indexOfAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`** - This method calls the first method after converting the `searchChars` string to a character array. If there is an issue with how the string is being converted or passed, it could lead to the failure observed.\n\n3. **`isEmpty(char[] array)`** - This method checks if the character array is empty. If the `searchChars` array is empty, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the `indexOfAny` method.\n\n4. **`isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`** - Similar to the previous method, this checks if the `CharSequence` is empty. If the `cs` is empty, it would also lead to the `indexOfAny` method returning `0`, which is not the expected behavior in the test.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be investigated further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test."
