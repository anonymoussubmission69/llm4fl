"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAny_StringCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected a value of `2` but received `0`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.indexOfAny` is not returning the expected index when searching for characters in the provided `CharSequence`.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.indexOfAny`**: This is the primary method being tested. The logic within this method is crucial as it determines how the index is calculated based on the characters in the `CharSequence` and the search array. Any issues in the loop or character comparison could lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty`**: This method checks if the character array is empty. If this method incorrectly identifies the array as non-empty or vice versa, it could affect the behavior of `indexOfAny`.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.isEmpty`**: Similar to `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`, this method checks if the `CharSequence` is empty. If it incorrectly identifies the `CharSequence` as empty, it could lead to the `indexOfAny` method returning `0` prematurely.\n\nGiven the relationships and potential propagation of faults from one method to another, all three methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
