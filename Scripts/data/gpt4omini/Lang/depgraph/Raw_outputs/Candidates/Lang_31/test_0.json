"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `false` but received `true`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsAny` is likely not functioning as expected when dealing with supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`** - This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for checking if any character in `searchChars` exists in `cs`. The failure suggests that it may not be correctly identifying the presence of characters, especially supplementary ones.\n\n2. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`** - This method is a wrapper that converts a `String` to a `char[]` and calls the first method. If the first method has an issue, this one might also propagate that issue.\n\n3. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`** - This method checks if the `searchChars` array is empty. If it incorrectly identifies an empty array, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the `containsAny` method.\n\n4. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`** - This method checks if the `CharSequence` is empty or null. If it incorrectly identifies a non-empty `CharSequence`, it could also lead to issues in the `containsAny` method.\n\nGiven the context of the failure and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
