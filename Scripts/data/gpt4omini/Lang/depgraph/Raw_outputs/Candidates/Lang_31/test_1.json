"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `false` but received `true`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsAny` is likely not functioning as expected when handling the provided character sequences.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.containsAny`**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for checking if any characters from the `searchChars` array are present in the `CharSequence`. The logic within this method should be scrutinized to understand why it returned `true` when it was expected to return `false`.\n\n2. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty`**: This method checks if the `searchChars` array is empty. If it incorrectly identifies the array as non-empty, it could lead to unexpected behavior in `containsAny`.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.isEmpty`**: This method checks if the `CharSequence` is empty. If it incorrectly identifies the `CharSequence` as non-empty, it could also lead to unexpected behavior in `containsAny`.\n\nGiven the relationships and potential propagation of faults, all three methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
