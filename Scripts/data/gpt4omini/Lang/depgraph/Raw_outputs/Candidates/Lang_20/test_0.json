"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testJoin_Objectarray` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` in the `StringUtils.join` method. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs in multiple overloaded versions of the `join` method in the `StringUtils` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils:join([Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/String;II)Ljava/lang/String;`\n2. `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils:join([Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;`\n3. `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils:join([Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/String;`\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **Method ID 0**: `join(Object[] array, String separator, int startIndex, int endIndex)` - This method has a check for `array == null`, but the handling of the `separator` and the subsequent logic may lead to a `NullPointerException` if not properly managed.\n2. **Method ID 1**: `join(Object[] array, String separator)` - This method returns `null` if the `array` is `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling method.\n3. **Method ID 2**: `join(T... elements)` - This method calls the previous `join` method with `null` as the separator, which could also lead to issues if the elements are not handled correctly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll three methods are suspicious as they are directly involved in the failure and could propagate the `NullPointerException`. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
