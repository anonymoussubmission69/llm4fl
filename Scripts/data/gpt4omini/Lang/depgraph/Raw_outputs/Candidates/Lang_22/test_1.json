"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testReducedFactory_int_int` is testing the `getReducedFraction` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is failing at the assertion `assertEquals(Integer.MIN_VALUE / 2, f.getNumerator());` which indicates that the expected value is not matching the actual value returned by the method.\n\n2. The `getReducedFraction` method is responsible for reducing fractions and handling edge cases such as zero denominators and integer overflow. The stack trace indicates that there is an issue with the calculation of the numerator when the input is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.\n\n3. The `greatestCommonDivisor` method is also covered in the test and is called within `getReducedFraction`. This method is crucial for reducing the fraction and could potentially contribute to the fault if it does not handle certain cases correctly.\n\n4. The constructor of the `Fraction` class is also covered, but it is less likely to be the source of the fault since it primarily initializes the object.\n\n5. The methods `getNumerator` and `getDenominator` are simple getters and are unlikely to be the source of the fault.\n\nBased on this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `getReducedFraction` (method_id: 0)\n- `greatestCommonDivisor` (method_id: 1)\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the logic that is failing in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
