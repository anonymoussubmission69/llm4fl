"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testGetTypeArguments` is failing due to an assertion that expected a size of 2 but received 0. This indicates that the method responsible for retrieving type arguments is likely not functioning as expected.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`getTypeArguments`** (method_id: 0 and method_id: 1): These methods are responsible for retrieving type arguments from classes. Since the test is checking the size of the returned map, any issues in these methods could lead to the failure observed.\n\n2. **`getClosestParentType`** (method_id: 2): This method is involved in determining the closest parent type, which could affect the type arguments being retrieved.\n\n3. **`isAssignable`** (method_id: 3 and method_id: 4): These methods check if one type is assignable to another. If there are issues with type assignability, it could lead to incorrect type arguments being returned.\n\n4. **`getRawType`** (method_id: 6): This method retrieves the raw type from a parameterized type, which is crucial for the type argument retrieval process.\n\n5. **`getTypeArguments` (overloaded)** (method_id: 7 and method_id: 11): These methods are also involved in retrieving type arguments based on different input types.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is likely that the methods responsible for type argument retrieval and type checking are the primary suspects.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11]\n}\n```"
