"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testJavaVersionAsInt` is failing due to an assertion that expected an integer value of `0` but received a float value of `0.0`. This indicates a potential issue with the method `toJavaVersionInt`, which is expected to return an integer but is returning a float instead.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `toVersionInt(int[])` - This method handles the conversion of an integer array to an integer version.\n2. `toJavaVersionIntArray(String, int)` - This method converts a version string into an integer array.\n3. `toJavaVersionInt(String)` - This method is responsible for converting a version string into a float, which is where the failure occurs.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n- `toJavaVersionInt(String)` because it directly leads to the failure by returning a float instead of an integer.\n- `toVersionInt(int[])` because it processes the output of `toJavaVersionIntArray` and could potentially be involved in the conversion logic that leads to the incorrect return type.\n- `toJavaVersionIntArray(String, int)` because it is responsible for creating the input for `toVersionInt`, and if it does not handle the input correctly, it could lead to issues in the subsequent methods.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
