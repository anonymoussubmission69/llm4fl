"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testPrimitiveTypeClassSerialization` is failing due to a `ClassNotFoundException` while trying to clone a primitive type using the `SerializationUtils.clone` method. The stack trace indicates that the error originates from the `clone` method in the `SerializationUtils` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `SerializationUtils.clone`\n2. `SerializationUtils.serialize` (overloaded)\n3. `ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream` constructor\n4. `SerializationUtils.serialize` (byte array version)\n5. `SerializationException` constructor\n6. `ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream.resolveClass`\n\nThe most suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- **`SerializationUtils.clone`**: This is the method directly involved in the failure, as it throws the `ClassNotFoundException`.\n- **`SerializationUtils.serialize`**: This method is called within `clone` and could be related to the serialization process that leads to the exception.\n- **`ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream.resolveClass`**: This method is responsible for resolving the class during deserialization and could be a point of failure if it cannot find the class.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 5]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0 corresponds to `SerializationUtils.clone`.\n- Method ID 1 corresponds to `SerializationUtils.serialize`.\n- Method ID 5 corresponds to `ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream.resolveClass`. \n\nThese methods are critical in the serialization and deserialization process, and their analysis may reveal the underlying fault causing the test to fail."
