    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testReducedFactory_int_int()` is testing the `getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is checking various cases including zero, normal fractions, improper fractions, negative fractions, and edge cases involving the minimum integer value.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that there is an `AssertionFailedError` occurring at line 336 of the `FractionTest` class, which suggests that the expected value does not match the actual value returned by the method being tested.\n\n3. The `getReducedFraction` method is responsible for reducing fractions and handling edge cases such as zero denominators and integer overflow. The logic within this method is complex and involves several branches that could lead to unexpected results.\n\n4. The methods that are covered by the failed test include:\n   - `Fraction.<init>(II)V`: Constructor for the `Fraction` class.\n   - `Fraction.getReducedFraction(II)Lorg/apache/commons/lang3/math/Fraction;`: The method under test that is likely causing the failure.\n   - `Fraction.getDenominator()I`: Getter for the denominator.\n   - `Fraction.getNumerator()I`: Getter for the numerator.\n   - `Fraction.greatestCommonDivisor(II)I`: A utility method used within `getReducedFraction` to compute the greatest common divisor.\n\nGiven the complexity of the `getReducedFraction` method and its interactions with the constructor and the GCD method, these methods are all potential candidates for further investigation.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0: Constructor, as it initializes the state of the `Fraction` object.\n- Method ID 1: `getReducedFraction`, the primary method under test.\n- Method ID 2: `getDenominator`, as it is involved in the output.\n- Method ID 3: `getNumerator`, as it is also involved in the output.\n- Method ID 4: `greatestCommonDivisor`, as it is used in the reduction logic and could affect the outcome."
