    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAny_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is designed to check the behavior of the `StringUtils.containsAny` method when dealing with supplementary characters. The test fails because it expected `false` but received `true`, indicating that there is likely a fault in the logic of the `containsAny` method.\n\nThe covered methods that are relevant to this test and may contain faults are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`** - This method is directly invoked in the test and is responsible for checking if any characters in `searchChars` are present in `cs`. The failure in the test suggests that there may be an issue in how this method processes supplementary characters.\n\n2. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`** - This method is also part of the `containsAny` functionality and is likely called within the first method. It includes logic that checks if the character sequence is empty and iterates through the characters, which could be where the fault lies.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`** - This method checks if the character sequence is empty. If it incorrectly identifies a sequence as non-empty, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the `containsAny` methods.\n\n4. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`** - This method checks if the character array is empty. Similar to the previous method, if it incorrectly identifies an array as non-empty, it could affect the outcome of the `containsAny` methods.\n\nGiven the context of the test and the methods involved, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 3, 1]\n}\n``` \n\nThis ranking is based on the direct invocation of `containsAny` in the test and the supporting methods that could influence its behavior."
