    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAnyBut_StringStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected the result of `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut` to be `2`, but it returned `3`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `indexOfAnyBut` method.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the `indexOfAnyBut` method, which is covered by the failed test. Additionally, the `isEmpty` method is also covered, as it is called within `indexOfAnyBut` to check for empty strings.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`indexOfAnyBut`**: This method is directly involved in the test and is returning an unexpected value. It needs to be analyzed to understand why it is returning `3` instead of `2`.\n2. **`isEmpty`**: This method is called within `indexOfAnyBut` to check if the input strings are empty. While it seems straightforward, if it incorrectly identifies a string as empty, it could lead to unexpected behavior in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious, but `indexOfAnyBut` is the primary focus since it is directly responsible for the test failure. The `isEmpty` method should also be reviewed to ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
