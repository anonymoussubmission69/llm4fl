    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testReducedFactory_int_int` is designed to validate the behavior of the `getReducedFraction` method, particularly focusing on various cases including zero, negative values, and edge cases involving `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.\n2. The stack trace indicates an `AssertionFailedError` where the expected value was `-1073741824` but the actual value returned was `-2147483648`. This discrepancy suggests that there is a potential issue in the calculation of the numerator or denominator, particularly when handling edge cases.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods:\n\n1. **Method 1 (`getReducedFraction`)**: This method is responsible for reducing fractions and includes logic for handling zero denominators, which is critical given the test cases. The method also has complex logic for handling edge cases, including integer overflow and greatest common divisor calculations. The presence of multiple branches and potential arithmetic exceptions makes this method highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Method 4 (`greatestCommonDivisor`)**: This method is used within `getReducedFraction` to simplify the fraction. If there is an error in how the GCD is calculated, it could lead to incorrect results in the reduced fraction. Given that the test fails on a specific value, this method could also be a source of the problem.\n\n3. **Method 0**: This method appears to be a constructor or initialization method. While it is important for setting up the state of the `Fraction` object, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure compared to the methods that perform calculations.\n\n4. **Method 2 (`getDenominator`)**: This method simply returns the denominator. It is unlikely to be the source of the problem since it does not perform any calculations.\n\n5. **Method 3 (`getNumerator`)**: Similar to `getDenominator`, this method returns the numerator without any calculations. It is also unlikely to be the source of the problem.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getReducedFraction method contains complex logic for reducing fractions, including handling edge cases and potential arithmetic exceptions.
