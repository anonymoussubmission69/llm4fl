    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **getReducedFraction (Method ID: 1)**: This method contains complex logic for reducing fractions, including handling edge cases such as zero denominators and potential arithmetic exceptions. The test failures indicate that the expected values do not match the actual values, particularly with extreme values like `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. The logic for handling negative values and the GCD calculation could lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.\n\n2. **greatestCommonDivisor (Method ID: 4)**: This method is used within `getReducedFraction` to simplify fractions. If there is an error in the GCD calculation, it could lead to incorrect results. The method has a complex structure and could potentially return incorrect values if the input values are not handled correctly.\n\n3. **Fraction Constructor (Method ID: 0)**: This method initializes the Fraction object. While it is important, it is less likely to be the cause of the test failure compared to the calculation methods. However, if the numerator or denominator is not set correctly, it could lead to issues.\n\n4. **getDenominator (Method ID: 2)**: This method simply returns the denominator without any calculations, making it unlikely to be the source of the problem.\n\n5. **getNumerator (Method ID: 3)**: This method also simply returns the numerator without any calculations, making it the least suspicious.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **getReducedFraction**: Ensure that the logic for handling edge cases (like `Integer.MIN_VALUE`) is correct. Add checks to prevent overflow and ensure that the GCD is calculated correctly. The return statement should be properly structured to handle all cases.\n\n- **greatestCommonDivisor**: Review the logic for calculating the GCD, especially the handling of negative values and the conditions for returning results. Ensure that the method correctly handles all edge cases.\n\n### ReRanked Methods:\nBased on the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
