    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_CharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing because the expected result of `StringUtils.containsNone` is `true`, but it is returning `false`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `containsNone` method of the `StringUtils` class.\n\nThe covered method identified is:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils:containsNone(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;[C)Z`\n\nThis method checks if a given `CharSequence` contains none of the characters in the provided character array. The failure suggests that the logic within this method may not be correctly identifying the presence of characters, especially in edge cases involving supplementary characters.\n\n### Suspicious Methods\n1. **StringUtils.containsNone**: This method is directly involved in the test and is returning an unexpected result.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is the `containsNone` method in the `StringUtils` class, as it is the source of the failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
