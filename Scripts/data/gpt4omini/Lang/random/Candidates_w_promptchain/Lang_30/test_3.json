    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsNone` is likely not functioning as expected when handling certain characters, specifically supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`\n2. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`\n\nBoth methods are responsible for checking if a given character sequence contains any characters from a specified set of invalid characters. The failure suggests that there may be an issue in how these methods handle edge cases, particularly with supplementary characters.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`** - This method is the entry point for the test and is likely where the issue originates.\n2. **`StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`** - This method is called within the first method and may also contribute to the failure if it does not handle the character checks correctly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the fault. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
