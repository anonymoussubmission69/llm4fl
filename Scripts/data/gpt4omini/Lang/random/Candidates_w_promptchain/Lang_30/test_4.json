    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_StringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsNone` is likely not functioning as expected when handling supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered method identified is:\n- `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`\n\nThis method is responsible for checking if the `CharSequence` contains none of the characters in the `invalidChars` string. Given that the test is specifically checking for cases involving supplementary characters, this method is the primary suspect.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is:\n- `StringUtils.containsNone`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
