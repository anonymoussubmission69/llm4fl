    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAnyBut_StringCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because the expected value (2) does not match the actual value (3) returned by the method `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `indexOfAnyBut` method or its dependencies.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[])`\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence)`\n3. `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut(CharSequence, char[])`\n\n### Analysis of Suspicious Methods:\n- **`StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`**: This is the primary method being tested. The failure indicates that the logic within this method is likely incorrect, especially in how it processes the input characters and determines the index.\n- **`StringUtils.isEmpty`**: This method is called within `indexOfAnyBut` to check if the input `CharSequence` is empty. If this method does not function correctly, it could lead to incorrect behavior in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n- **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty`**: This method checks if the character array is empty. If it incorrectly identifies a non-empty array as empty, it could also affect the logic in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe methods that need to be analyzed further for potential faults are:\n- `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`\n- `StringUtils.isEmpty`\n- `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
