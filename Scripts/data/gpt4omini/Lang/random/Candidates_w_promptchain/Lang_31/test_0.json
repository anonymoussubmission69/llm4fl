    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyStringWithSupplementaryChars` is designed to check the behavior of the `StringUtils.containsAny` method when dealing with supplementary characters. The test fails when it expects `false` but receives `true`, indicating a potential issue in the `containsAny` method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)` - This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the fault lies since the test is failing due to its output.\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)` - This method is called within `containsAny` to check if the input is empty, which could affect the logic if not handled correctly.\n3. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)` - This method is also called within `containsAny` to check if the search characters are empty, which could also influence the outcome.\n4. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)` - This method is called within the first `containsAny` method and is responsible for the actual character comparison logic.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, the most suspicious methods to analyze further are the `containsAny` methods, as they are directly related to the test case. The `isEmpty` methods are also relevant as they could affect the flow of logic.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n```"
