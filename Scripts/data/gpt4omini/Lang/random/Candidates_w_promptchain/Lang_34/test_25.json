    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testReflectionIntArrayArray` is designed to test the behavior of the `ToStringBuilder` class when handling arrays, particularly with null values.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `AssertionFailedError` occurred because the expected output was `<null>`, but the actual output was `{}`. This suggests that the method responsible for converting the array to a string representation did not handle null values correctly.\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include several methods from the `ReflectionToStringBuilder` and `ToStringStyle` classes, which are responsible for generating string representations of objects and arrays.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`reflectionAppendArray`** (method_id: 1): This method is responsible for appending array details to the string buffer. It directly interacts with the array being tested.\n2. **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail`** (method_id: 6): This method handles the details of appending array elements, including null handling.\n3. **`appendFieldsIn`** (method_id: 4): This method checks if the class is an array and calls `reflectionAppendArray`, which is crucial for the test case.\n4. **`toString`** (method_id: 22): This method is responsible for generating the final string representation of the object, which is the output being asserted in the test.\n5. **`appendNullText`** (method_id: 28): This method appends a specific text for null values, which is relevant to the expected output of `<null>`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 6, 22, 28]\n}\n```"
