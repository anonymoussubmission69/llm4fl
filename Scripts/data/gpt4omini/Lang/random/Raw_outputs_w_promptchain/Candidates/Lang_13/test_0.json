"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testPrimitiveTypeClassSerialization` is failing due to a `ClassNotFoundException` while trying to clone a primitive type class using the `SerializationUtils.clone` method. The stack trace indicates that the error originates from the `clone` method in the `SerializationUtils` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `serialize(Serializable obj)`: This method serializes an object to a byte array.\n2. `resolveClass(ObjectStreamClass desc)`: This method resolves a class from the serialized data.\n3. `serialize(Serializable obj, OutputStream outputStream)`: This method serializes an object to a specified output stream.\n4. `SerializationException(String msg, Throwable cause)`: This is a constructor for the `SerializationException`.\n5. `ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream(InputStream in, ClassLoader classLoader)`: This constructor initializes an input stream with a class loader.\n6. `clone(T object)`: This method attempts to clone a serializable object.\n\nThe most suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `clone(T object)`: This is where the cloning process starts and the exception is thrown.\n- `resolveClass(ObjectStreamClass desc)`: This method is responsible for resolving the class name, which is likely where the `ClassNotFoundException` is triggered.\n- `serialize(Serializable obj)`: This method is involved in the serialization process, which is a critical part of cloning.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 1, 0]\n}\n``` \n\nHere, method IDs 5, 1, and 0 correspond to `clone`, `resolveClass`, and `serialize` respectively, which are critical in the cloning and serialization process that led to the failure."
