"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReflectionFloatArray` is failing due to an assertion that checks if a null array is correctly represented as `<null>`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method, which is called after the assertion for the null array.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ToStringStyle` and `ReflectionToStringBuilder` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`ToStringStyle:appendDetail`** - This method appends the value to the buffer. If the value is null, it may not handle it correctly.\n2. **`ReflectionToStringBuilder:reflectionAppendArray`** - This method is responsible for appending array details. If it does not handle null arrays properly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n3. **`ToStringStyle:reflectionAppendArrayDetail`** - This method appends details of the array, and if it does not handle null values correctly, it could also be a source of the issue.\n4. **`ToStringStyle:appendNullText`** - This method is likely responsible for appending a specific representation for null values. If it is not invoked or does not function correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n5. **`ToStringBuilder:toString`** - This method is responsible for converting the object to a string representation. If it does not handle null objects correctly, it could propagate the issue.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 7, 14, 15]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
