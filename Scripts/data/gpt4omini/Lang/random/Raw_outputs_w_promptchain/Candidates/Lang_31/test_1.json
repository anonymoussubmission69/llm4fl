"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because it expected `false` but received `true` from the `StringUtils.containsAny` method. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the logic of the `containsAny` method or its dependencies.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`: This method checks if a given `CharSequence` is empty or null.\n2. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`: This method checks if a given character array is empty or null.\n3. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`: This method checks if any character from the `searchChars` array is present in the `CharSequence cs`.\n\nThe most suspicious method here is `StringUtils.containsAny`, as it is directly involved in the failing assertion. The `isEmpty` methods are also relevant because they are called within `containsAny`, and if they return incorrect results, they could lead to the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0 (`isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`) and Method ID 1 (`isEmpty(char[] array)`) are included because they are part of the logic that could affect the outcome of `containsAny`.\n- Method ID 2 (`containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`) is included as it is the method directly responsible for the test failure."
