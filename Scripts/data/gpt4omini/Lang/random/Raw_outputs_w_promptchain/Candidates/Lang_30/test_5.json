"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAny_StringCharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `false` but received `true`. This indicates that the method being tested is likely returning an unexpected result.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `ArrayUtils:isEmpty(char[])`\n2. `StringUtils:isEmpty(CharSequence)`\n3. `StringUtils:containsAny(CharSequence, char[])`\n\n### Analysis of Suspicious Methods:\n\n1. **`StringUtils:containsAny(CharSequence, char[])`**:\n   - This method is directly involved in the test case. The test checks if certain characters are contained within a string, and the failure indicates that it may not be handling the edge cases correctly, particularly with supplementary characters.\n\n2. **`StringUtils:isEmpty(CharSequence)`**:\n   - This method is called within `containsAny` to check if the input string or the search characters are empty. If it incorrectly identifies a non-empty string as empty, it could lead to the unexpected behavior observed in the test.\n\n3. **`ArrayUtils:isEmpty(char[])`**:\n   - Similar to `isEmpty(CharSequence)`, this method checks if the character array is empty. If it fails to correctly identify an empty array, it could also affect the outcome of `containsAny`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe methods that need to be analyzed further to find the fault are primarily those involved in the `containsAny` logic, as they directly influence the test's outcome. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
