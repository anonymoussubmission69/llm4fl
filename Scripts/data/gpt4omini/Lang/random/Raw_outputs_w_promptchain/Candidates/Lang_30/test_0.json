"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAny_StringCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected a value of `2` but received `0`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.indexOfAny` is not returning the expected index when searching for characters in the provided `CharSequence`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**: This is the primary method being tested. The failure is directly related to its logic, as it is responsible for finding the index of any character from the `searchChars` in the `CharSequence`.\n\n2. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`**: This method checks if the provided character array is empty. It is called within `indexOfAny`, and if it incorrectly identifies the array as non-empty, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`**: Similar to `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`, this method checks if the `CharSequence` is empty. If it incorrectly identifies the `CharSequence` as non-empty, it could also affect the outcome of the `indexOfAny` method.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the most suspicious method is `StringUtils.indexOfAny`, as it is the one directly involved in the failing assertion. However, the other two methods are also relevant since they are used to validate inputs before processing.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 0**: `StringUtils.indexOfAny` - Directly related to the failure.\n- **Method ID 1**: `ArrayUtils.isEmpty` - Could affect the logic in `indexOfAny`.\n- **Method ID 2**: `StringUtils.isEmpty` - Also could affect the logic in `indexOfAny`."
