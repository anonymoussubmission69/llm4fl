"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAny_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is designed to check the behavior of the `StringUtils.containsAny` method when dealing with supplementary characters. The test fails because it expected `false` but received `true`, indicating that the method is incorrectly identifying the presence of a character.\n\nThe stack trace points to the `StringUtils.containsAny` method as the source of the failure. The covered methods that are relevant to this test include:\n\n1. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)` - This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the fault lies.\n2. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)` - This method is also called within the first `containsAny` method and could be contributing to the issue.\n3. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)` - This method is used to check if the input character sequence is empty, which could affect the logic flow.\n4. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)` - This method checks if the character array is empty, which is also part of the logic in `containsAny`.\n\nGiven the context, the most suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`\n- `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`\n\nThese methods are directly related to the failure and could be propagating the fault. The `isEmpty` methods are also relevant but less likely to be the direct cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3]\n}\n```"
