"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAnyBut_StringStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because the expected value (2) does not match the actual value (3) returned by the method `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `indexOfAnyBut` method.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs during the assertion of the expected value, which suggests that the logic within the `indexOfAnyBut` method is not functioning as intended. The method checks for characters in the input string that are not present in the `searchChars` string, and it returns the index of the first such character. If the logic is incorrect, it could lead to an off-by-one error or similar issues.\n\nAdditionally, the `isEmpty` method is called within `indexOfAnyBut` to check if either of the input strings is empty. If this method does not work correctly, it could also lead to unexpected behavior in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n1. `indexOfAnyBut` - This is the primary method where the failure occurs.\n2. `isEmpty` - This method is used within `indexOfAnyBut` and could affect its behavior.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
