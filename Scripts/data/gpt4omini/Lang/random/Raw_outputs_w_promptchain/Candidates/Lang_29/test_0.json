"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testJavaVersionAsInt` is failing due to an assertion that expected an integer value of `0` but received a float value of `0.0`. This indicates a potential issue with the method `toJavaVersionInt`, which is expected to return an integer but is returning a float instead.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `toJavaVersionIntArray(String version, int limit)` - This method is responsible for converting a version string into an integer array.\n2. `toVersionInt(int[] javaVersions)` - This method converts an integer array into a single integer value.\n3. `toJavaVersionInt(String version)` - This method calls the above two methods and is the direct source of the failure.\n\nGiven that the failure is related to the return type of `toJavaVersionInt`, it is crucial to analyze the methods that it calls, particularly `toVersionInt` and `toJavaVersionIntArray`, as they may contribute to the incorrect return type.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nIn conclusion, all three methods are suspicious as they are interconnected, and the fault may propagate through them. The method `toJavaVersionInt` is the most critical as it directly relates to the test failure, but the other two methods should also be examined to understand how they contribute to the final output."
