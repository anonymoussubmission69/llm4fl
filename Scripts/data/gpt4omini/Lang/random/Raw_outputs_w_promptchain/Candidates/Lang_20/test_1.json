"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testJoin_ArrayChar` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` in the `StringUtils.join` method. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurs at line 3298 in the `StringUtils` class, specifically in the `join` method.\n\nThe test is asserting various cases of joining arrays with a separator, and the failure occurs when the method is called with a null array. The `join` method has a check for null arrays, but it seems that the logic may not be handling the null case correctly, leading to the exception.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `StringUtils.join(Object[] array, char separator)` - This method is responsible for joining an array of objects with a specified separator.\n2. `StringUtils.join(Object[] array, char separator, int startIndex, int endIndex)` - This method is an overloaded version that joins a subarray defined by start and end indices.\n\nBoth methods are suspicious because they are directly involved in the operation that caused the failure. The first method should return null when the input array is null, but the second method does not seem to handle the null case properly, which could lead to the `NullPointerException`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
