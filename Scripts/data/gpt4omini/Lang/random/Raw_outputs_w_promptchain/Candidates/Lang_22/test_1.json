"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testReducedFactory_int_int()` is testing the `getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is designed to check various scenarios including normal fractions, improper fractions, negative fractions, and edge cases like zero denominators.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that there is an `AssertionFailedError` occurring at line 336 of the `FractionTest` class, which suggests that the expected value does not match the actual value returned by the method being tested.\n\n3. The `getReducedFraction` method is responsible for reducing fractions and handling edge cases such as zero denominators and integer overflow. The logic within this method is complex and involves several branches that could lead to unexpected results.\n\n4. The methods `getNumerator()` and `getDenominator()` are also covered in the test, but they are simple getter methods and are less likely to be the source of the fault.\n\n5. The `greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)` method is called within `getReducedFraction` and could also be a point of failure if it does not correctly compute the GCD.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be further investigated:\n\n- `getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)` (method_id: 1) - This is the primary method being tested and is likely where the fault lies.\n- `greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)` (method_id: 4) - This method is used within `getReducedFraction` and could contribute to incorrect results if it does not function as expected.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4]\n}\n```"
