"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsIgnoreCase_LocaleIndependence` is failing due to an assertion error related to the `StringUtils.containsIgnoreCase` method. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when the method is called with certain inputs, leading to an unexpected result.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `StringUtils.containsIgnoreCase(String str, String searchStr)`: This method is responsible for checking if one string contains another, ignoring case differences. It calls another method `contains` after converting both strings to uppercase.\n2. `StringUtils.contains(String str, String searchStr)`: This method checks if one string contains another by using the `indexOf` method.\n\nBoth methods are suspicious because:\n- The failure in the test indicates that the logic in `containsIgnoreCase` may not be handling certain locale-specific cases correctly.\n- The `contains` method is also involved, as it is called by `containsIgnoreCase`, and any issues in string comparison could propagate from there.\n\nThus, the potential suspicious methods that need further analysis are:\n- `StringUtils.containsIgnoreCase`\n- `StringUtils.contains`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
