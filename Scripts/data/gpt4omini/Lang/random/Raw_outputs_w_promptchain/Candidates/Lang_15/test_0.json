"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIsAssignable` is failing due to an assertion error related to type assignability. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `isAssignable` method of the `TypeUtils` class, which is responsible for checking if one type can be assigned to another.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **isAssignable(Type, ParameterizedType, Map)** - This method is directly involved in the assignability check and is likely where the logic error resides.\n2. **isAssignable(Type, Type)** - This method is a public interface for checking assignability and may delegate to other methods, including the one above.\n3. **getTypeArguments(Type, Class, Map)** - This method is involved in retrieving type arguments, which is crucial for the assignability checks.\n4. **getRawType(ParameterizedType)** - This method retrieves the raw type from a parameterized type, which is essential for the assignability logic.\n5. **substituteTypeVariables(Type, Map)** - This method substitutes type variables, which may affect the assignability checks if not handled correctly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in any of them could propagate and lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 8, 2, 16, 0]\n}\n```"
