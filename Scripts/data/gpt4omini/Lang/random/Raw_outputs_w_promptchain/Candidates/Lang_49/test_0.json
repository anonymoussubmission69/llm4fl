"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testReduce()` is testing the `reduce()` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is failing at the assertion that checks if the denominator of the reduced fraction is equal to 1, but it is returning 100 instead.\n\n2. The `reduce()` method calls `greatestCommonDivisor()` to compute the GCD of the numerator and denominator. If the GCD is 1, it returns the current fraction; otherwise, it attempts to create a new fraction with the reduced values.\n\n3. The `getNumerator()` and `getDenominator()` methods are used to retrieve the numerator and denominator of the fraction, respectively. These methods are likely involved in the assertions that are failing.\n\n4. The `getFraction()` method is responsible for creating a new `Fraction` object and could also be a source of issues if it does not handle certain cases correctly (e.g., zero denominators).\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `reduce()` (method_id: 3): This is the method under test and is directly responsible for the failure.\n- `greatestCommonDivisor()` (method_id: 1): This method is called within `reduce()` and could be returning an incorrect GCD.\n- `getNumerator()` (method_id: 0) and `getDenominator()` (method_id: 4): These methods are used in the assertions and could be returning incorrect values.\n- `getFraction()` (method_id: 5): This method is responsible for creating fractions and could be involved in the issue if it does not handle certain cases correctly.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]\n}\n```"
