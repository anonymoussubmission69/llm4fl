"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test is failing because the expected numerator is 1, but the actual result is 100. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the `reduce()` method or the `getFraction()` method, as these methods are responsible for creating and reducing the fraction.\n\n2. The `reduce()` method is supposed to simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). If the GCD is not calculated correctly, the fraction will not be reduced properly.\n\n3. The `greatestCommonDivisor()` method has a complex implementation that may not handle all cases correctly, especially with negative values and edge cases.\n\n4. The `getFraction()` method is responsible for creating a fraction from the numerator and denominator. If it does not handle the case of zero denominators correctly, it could lead to unexpected results.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The greatestCommonDivisor method has a complex implementation that may not handle all cases correctly, especially with negative values and edge cases.
