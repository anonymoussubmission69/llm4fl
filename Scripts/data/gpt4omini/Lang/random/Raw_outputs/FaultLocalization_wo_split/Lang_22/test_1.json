"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test `testReducedFactory_int_int` is designed to validate the behavior of the `getReducedFraction` method, particularly focusing on various cases including zero, negative values, and edge cases involving integer limits.\n2. The stack trace indicates an `AssertionFailedError` where the expected value was `-1073741824` but the actual value returned was `-2147483648`. This discrepancy suggests that there is a potential issue in the logic of the `getReducedFraction` method, particularly in how it handles the numerator and denominator, especially when dealing with edge cases like `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods:\n\n1. **Method 1 (`getReducedFraction`)**: This method is the most suspicious because it directly handles the logic for reducing fractions. The error in the test indicates that there is likely a flaw in how it processes the numerator and denominator, especially with edge cases. The handling of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and the conditions for normalization and reduction could lead to incorrect results.\n\n2. **Method 4 (`greatestCommonDivisor`)**: This method is also suspicious as it is used in the fraction reduction process. If the GCD calculation is incorrect, it could lead to improper reduction of the fraction, which would affect the final output of `getReducedFraction`.\n\n3. **Method 0 (Constructor)**: While this method initializes the fraction object, it is less likely to be the source of the error since it does not contain any logic that would affect the fraction's value directly. However, if the constructor does not properly set the numerator and denominator, it could lead to issues later.\n\n4. **Method 3 (`getNumerator`)**: This method simply returns the numerator. It is unlikely to be the source of the error since it does not perform any calculations or logic that could lead to an incorrect value.\n\n5. **Method 2 (`getDenominator`)**: Similar to `getNumerator`, this method just returns the denominator and is the least suspicious as it does not involve any complex logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The getReducedFraction method contains the logic for reducing fractions and is directly responsible for the output that failed the test.
