"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `testLang294` is attempting to delete all occurrences of the string `\"\\n%BLAH%\"` from a `StrBuilder` object. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred during the execution of the `deleteImpl` method, which is called by `deleteAll`.\n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n\n1. **Method 0: `deleteAll(String str)`**\n   - This method is responsible for finding all occurrences of the specified string and calling `deleteImpl` to remove them. The loop continues until no more occurrences are found.\n   - **Suspicion**: If the `indexOf` method does not return valid indices (for example, if it returns -1), the loop could potentially lead to an invalid call to `deleteImpl`, which could cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n   - **Rank**: 1 (most suspicious)\n\n2. **Method 1: `indexOf(String str, int startIndex)`**\n   - This method is supposed to find the index of the specified string starting from a given index. It has checks for null strings and bounds.\n   - **Suspicion**: If `startIndex` is not properly managed or if the string is not found, it could lead to incorrect behavior in `deleteAll`. However, the method does have checks for bounds.\n   - **Rank**: 2 (moderately suspicious)\n\n3. **Method 2: `deleteImpl(int startIndex, int endIndex, int len)`**\n   - This method performs the actual deletion by shifting elements in the buffer. It uses `System.arraycopy`, which can throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the indices are incorrect.\n   - **Suspicion**: This method is directly responsible for the exception, but it relies on the correctness of the indices passed to it. If `deleteAll` or `indexOf` provides invalid indices, this method will fail.\n   - **Rank**: 3 (least suspicious)\n\n### Final Ranking in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The deleteAll method is responsible for finding and deleting occurrences of a string.
