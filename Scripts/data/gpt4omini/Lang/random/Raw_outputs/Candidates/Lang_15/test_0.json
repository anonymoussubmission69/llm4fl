"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIsAssignable` is failing due to an assertion error related to type assignability. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when checking if a certain type is assignable to another type using the `TypeUtils.isAssignable` method.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`isAssignable(Type type, ParameterizedType toParameterizedType, Map<TypeVariable<?>, Type> typeVarAssigns)`** - This method is directly involved in checking type assignability, which is the core of the test failure.\n2. **`isAssignable(Type type, Type toType)`** - This method is a public interface for checking assignability and may be calling the more specific `isAssignable` methods.\n3. **`isAssignable(Type type, WildcardType toWildcardType, Map<TypeVariable<?>, Type> typeVarAssigns)`** - This method handles wildcard types, which are often involved in generics and could be a source of the issue.\n4. **`getTypeArguments(Type type, Class<?> toClass, Map<TypeVariable<?>, Type> typeVarAssigns)`** - This method is responsible for retrieving type arguments, which may affect the assignability checks.\n5. **`getImplicitLowerBounds(WildcardType wildcardType)`** - This method retrieves lower bounds for wildcard types, which could be relevant in the context of the test.\n6. **`getImplicitUpperBounds(WildcardType wildcardType)`** - Similar to the lower bounds method, this could also play a role in the assignability checks.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, especially since they are all involved in type checking and generics.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 8, 9, 1, 12, 2]\n}\n```"
