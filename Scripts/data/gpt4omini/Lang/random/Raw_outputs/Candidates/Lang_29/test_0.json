"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testJavaVersionAsInt` is failing due to an assertion that expected an integer value of `0` but received a float value of `0.0`. This indicates a potential issue with the method `toJavaVersionInt` in the `SystemUtils` class, which is expected to return an integer but is returning a float instead.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `toJavaVersionIntArray(String version, int limit)` - This method is responsible for converting a version string into an integer array.\n2. `toVersionInt(int[] javaVersions)` - This method converts an integer array into a single integer.\n3. `toJavaVersionInt(String version)` - This method is the one directly called in the test and is expected to return an integer.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n- `toJavaVersionInt` (method_id: 2) - This is the method directly involved in the test and is returning a float instead of an integer.\n- `toVersionInt` (method_id: 1) - This method processes the integer array and could be contributing to the incorrect return type.\n- `toJavaVersionIntArray` (method_id: 0) - This method prepares the data for `toVersionInt` and could also be a source of the issue if it does not handle the input correctly.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
