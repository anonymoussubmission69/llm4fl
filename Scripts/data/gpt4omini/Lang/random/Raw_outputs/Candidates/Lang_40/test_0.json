"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsIgnoreCase_LocaleIndependence` is failing due to an assertion error when checking the behavior of the `StringUtils.containsIgnoreCase` method. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when the method is called with specific string inputs that are expected to return true or false based on locale independence.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `StringUtils.containsIgnoreCase(String str, String searchStr)`\n2. `StringUtils.contains(String str, String searchStr)`\n\nThe first method, `containsIgnoreCase`, is directly involved in the test and is likely where the fault originates. The second method, `contains`, is called within `containsIgnoreCase` and could also be a source of the issue if it does not handle certain cases correctly.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`StringUtils.containsIgnoreCase`** - This method is directly related to the test and is responsible for the locale-independent string comparison.\n2. **`StringUtils.contains`** - This method is called by `containsIgnoreCase` and could be contributing to the failure if it does not correctly handle the input strings.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the fault. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
