"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testEscapedQuote_LANG_477` is designed to test the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class, specifically its ability to format a string with escaped quotes.\n2. The stack trace indicates an `OutOfMemoryError`, which suggests that there may be an issue with how strings are being handled or constructed within the methods of the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include constructors and methods that manipulate strings, such as `appendQuotedString` and `applyPattern`.\n\nThe covered methods that are potentially suspicious and may lead to the fault are:\n\n- **Method ID 0**: `ExtendedMessageFormat.<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/Map;)V` - The constructor initializes the object and calls another constructor, which may lead to issues if the pattern is not handled correctly.\n- **Method ID 1**: `ExtendedMessageFormat:applyPattern(Ljava/lang/String;)V` - This method is responsible for applying the pattern and contains logic that could lead to excessive string manipulation, potentially causing memory issues.\n- **Method ID 2**: `ExtendedMessageFormat.<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/util/Locale;Ljava/util/Map;)V` - Similar to method ID 0, this constructor also initializes the object and applies the pattern, which could contribute to the memory issue.\n- **Method ID 3**: `ExtendedMessageFormat:appendQuotedString(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/text/ParsePosition;Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;Z)Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;` - This method is involved in appending quoted strings and could be a source of excessive memory usage if not managed properly.\n- **Method ID 4**: `ExtendedMessageFormat:next(Ljava/text/ParsePosition;)Ljava/text/ParsePosition;` - While this method is simple, it is part of the string parsing logic and could indirectly contribute to the memory issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n```"
