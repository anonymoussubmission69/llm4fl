"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testLANG807` is designed to check the behavior of the `RandomStringUtils.random` method when it is expected to throw an `IllegalArgumentException`. The test fails because the exception message does not contain the expected substrings \"start\" and \"end\".\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils.random(int count, int start, int end, boolean letters, boolean numbers)`\n2. `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils.random(int count, int start, int end, boolean letters, boolean numbers, char[] chars, Random random)`\n\nThe first method is directly called in the test, and the second method is likely a helper method that is invoked within the first method. The failure indicates that there may be an issue with how the parameters are being handled, particularly with the `start` and `end` values.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **Method ID 0**: `random(int count, int start, int end, boolean letters, boolean numbers)` - This method is directly involved in the test and is expected to throw an exception.\n2. **Method ID 1**: `random(int count, int start, int end, boolean letters, boolean numbers, char[] chars, Random random)` - This method is likely called within the first method and may also contribute to the issue.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious as they are involved in the logic that leads to the exception being thrown. The failure of the test suggests that there may be a problem with how the parameters are validated or how the exception messages are constructed.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
