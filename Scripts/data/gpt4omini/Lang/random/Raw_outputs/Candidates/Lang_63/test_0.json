"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testJiraLang281` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` where the expected result was \"09\" but the actual result was \"-2\". This indicates that there is likely an issue with the calculation of the duration between the two dates being formatted.\n\nThe test uses the `DurationFormatUtils.formatPeriod` method, which is responsible for formatting the period between two dates. The methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n\n1. **`formatPeriod(long startMillis, long endMillis, String format)`** - This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for formatting the period.\n2. **`formatPeriod(long startMillis, long endMillis, String format, boolean padWithZeros, TimeZone timezone)`** - This method is called within the previous method and handles the actual formatting logic.\n3. **`lexx(String format)`** - This method is responsible for parsing the format string and generating tokens, which are used in the formatting process.\n4. **`reduceAndCorrect(Calendar start, Calendar end, int field, int difference)`** - This method is used to adjust the values of the start and end calendars, which could affect the final output.\n5. **`containsTokenWithValue(Token[] tokens, Object value)`** - This method checks if a token with a specific value exists, which could influence the formatting logic.\n6. **`format(Token[] tokens, int years, int months, int days, int hours, int minutes, int seconds, int milliseconds, boolean padWithZeros)`** - This method is responsible for constructing the final formatted string from the tokens.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is likely that the issue lies within the logic of these methods, particularly in how the duration is calculated and formatted.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 5, 0, 4, 6, 9]\n}\n```"
