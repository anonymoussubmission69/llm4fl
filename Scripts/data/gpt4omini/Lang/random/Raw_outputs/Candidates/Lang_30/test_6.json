"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAnyBut_StringCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because the expected value (2) does not match the actual value (3) returned by the method `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `indexOfAnyBut` method or its dependencies.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[])`\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence)`\n3. `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut(CharSequence, char[])`\n\n### Analysis of Suspicious Methods:\n- **`StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`**: This is the primary method being tested. The failure indicates that the logic within this method may not be correctly handling the input, especially with supplementary characters.\n- **`StringUtils.isEmpty`**: This method is called within `indexOfAnyBut` to check if the input `CharSequence` is empty. If this check fails, it could lead to incorrect behavior in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n- **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty`**: This method checks if the `searchChars` array is empty. If it incorrectly returns true, it could also affect the logic in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe methods that need to be analyzed further to find the fault are:\n- `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`\n- `StringUtils.isEmpty`\n- `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and an issue in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
