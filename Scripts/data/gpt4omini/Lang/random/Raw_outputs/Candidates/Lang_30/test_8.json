"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_CharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing because it expected a `true` result from the `StringUtils.containsNone` method but received `false`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `containsNone` method of the `StringUtils` class.\n\nThe covered method identified is:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils:containsNone(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;[C)Z` (method_id: 0)\n\nThe method `containsNone` checks if a given `CharSequence` contains none of the characters in the provided character array. The failure suggests that the logic within this method may not be correctly handling the edge cases related to supplementary characters, which are being tested in the failing test case.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]  // The potential suspicious method's ids\n}\n```"
