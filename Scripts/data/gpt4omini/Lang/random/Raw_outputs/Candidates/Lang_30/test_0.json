"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAny_StringCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected a value of `2` but received `0`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.indexOfAny` is not returning the expected index when searching for characters in the provided `CharSequence`.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.indexOfAny`**: This is the primary method being tested. The failure indicates that it is not correctly identifying the index of the character in the `CharSequence`. The logic within this method should be examined closely, especially how it handles the input characters and the search array.\n\n2. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty`**: This method checks if the character array is empty. If it incorrectly identifies the array as non-empty or vice versa, it could lead to unexpected behavior in `indexOfAny`.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.isEmpty`**: Similar to `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`, this method checks if the `CharSequence` is empty. If it incorrectly identifies the `CharSequence` as empty, it could also lead to incorrect behavior in `indexOfAny`.\n\nGiven the relationships between these methods, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\nThis indicates that all three methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
