"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_StringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsNone` is likely not functioning as expected when handling supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered method identified is:\n- `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`\n\nThis method is responsible for checking if the `CharSequence` contains none of the characters specified in `invalidChars`. Given that the test is failing when this method is invoked, it is crucial to analyze its implementation further.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **StringUtils.containsNone** - This method is directly involved in the failing test and is responsible for the logic that is being tested.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is `StringUtils.containsNone`, as it is the method that the test is directly calling and is responsible for the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
