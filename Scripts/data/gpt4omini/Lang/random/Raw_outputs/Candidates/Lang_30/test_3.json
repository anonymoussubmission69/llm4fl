"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `true` but received `false`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsNone` is likely not functioning as expected when handling certain characters, specifically supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n1. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`\n2. `StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`\n\nBoth methods are responsible for checking if a given character sequence contains any characters from a specified set of invalid characters. The failure suggests that there may be an issue with how these methods handle edge cases, particularly with supplementary characters.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. **`StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`** - This method is the entry point for the test and is directly involved in the assertion that failed.\n2. **`StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`** - This method is called within the first method and is responsible for the actual character comparison logic.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further to identify the fault. The issue may stem from how they handle null values or the character comparison logic, especially with supplementary characters.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
