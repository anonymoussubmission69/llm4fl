"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAny_StringCharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `false` but received `true`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsAny` is likely not handling the input as expected, particularly with respect to supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **ArrayUtils.isEmpty**: This method checks if a character array is empty or null. While it is not directly related to the failure, it is part of the logic in `StringUtils.containsAny`.\n\n2. **StringUtils.isEmpty**: Similar to `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`, this checks if a `CharSequence` is empty or null. It is also part of the logic in `StringUtils.containsAny`.\n\n3. **StringUtils.containsAny**: This is the primary method under scrutiny, as it is directly involved in the failing assertion. The logic within this method includes checks for empty inputs and iterates through characters to find matches, which is where the failure likely originates.\n\nGiven the context, the most suspicious method that needs further analysis is `StringUtils.containsAny`, as it is the method that is expected to return `false` but is returning `true` instead. The other two methods, while part of the call chain, are less likely to be the source of the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 0, 1]\n}\n```\n\nIn this ranking:\n- `2` (StringUtils.containsAny) is the most suspicious and should be analyzed first.\n- `0` (ArrayUtils.isEmpty) and `1` (StringUtils.isEmpty) are included as they are part of the logic but are less likely to be the source of the fault."
