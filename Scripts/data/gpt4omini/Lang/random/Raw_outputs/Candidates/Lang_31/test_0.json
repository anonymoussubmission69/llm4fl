"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because it expected `false` but received `true` from the `StringUtils.containsAny` method. This indicates that there is likely a fault in the logic of the `containsAny` method or its related methods.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test are:\n\n1. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`\n3. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`\n4. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`\n\n### Analysis of Suspicious Methods:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`**: This method is directly involved in the test case and is the primary suspect since the test is failing due to its output.\n\n2. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`**: This method is called within `containsAny` to check if the input is empty. If it incorrectly identifies a non-empty input as empty, it could lead to incorrect behavior in `containsAny`.\n\n3. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`**: This method is also called within `containsAny` to check if the search characters are empty. Similar to the previous method, if it fails to correctly identify an empty array, it could affect the outcome of `containsAny`.\n\n4. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**: This method is called by the first `containsAny` method when `searchChars` is not null. If there is a logical error in this method, it could lead to the unexpected result observed in the test.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be further investigated:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n```"
