"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because it expected `false` but received `true` from the `StringUtils.containsAny` method. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the `containsAny` method is determining if any characters from the `searchChars` array are present in the `CharSequence`.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.containsAny`**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for checking if any characters from the provided array are present in the `CharSequence`. Since the test is failing at this point, it is crucial to analyze this method.\n\n2. **`StringUtils.isEmpty`**: This method is called within `containsAny` to check if the `CharSequence` or the `searchChars` array is empty. If this method does not behave as expected, it could lead to incorrect results in `containsAny`.\n\n3. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty`**: This method is also called within `containsAny` to check if the `searchChars` array is empty. Similar to `isEmpty`, any issues here could affect the outcome of the `containsAny` method.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0 corresponds to `StringUtils.isEmpty`.\n- Method ID 1 corresponds to `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`.\n- Method ID 2 corresponds to `StringUtils.containsAny`. \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
