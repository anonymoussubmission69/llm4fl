"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testReflectionIntArrayArray` is designed to test the behavior of the `ToStringBuilder` class when handling arrays, particularly with null values.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `AssertionFailedError` occurred because the expected output was `<null>`, but the actual output was `{}`. This suggests that the method responsible for converting the array to a string representation did not handle the null value correctly.\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include several methods from the `ReflectionToStringBuilder` and `ToStringStyle` classes, which are responsible for generating string representations of objects and arrays.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`reflectionAppendArray` (method_id: 1)**: This method is responsible for appending array details to the string buffer. It directly interacts with the array being tested.\n- **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail` (method_id: 6)**: This method handles the details of appending array elements, including null handling.\n- **`appendFieldsIn` (method_id: 4)**: This method checks if the class is an array and calls `reflectionAppendArray`, which is crucial for the test case.\n- **`appendStart` (method_id: 5)**: This method is involved in starting the string representation, which may affect how null values are treated.\n- **`appendEnd` (method_id: 11)**: This method finalizes the string representation and may also influence the output when null values are present.\n- **`getUpToClass` (method_id: 0)**: This method may be relevant if the test involves class hierarchy and how it affects the string representation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 5, 6, 11, 0]\n}\n```"
