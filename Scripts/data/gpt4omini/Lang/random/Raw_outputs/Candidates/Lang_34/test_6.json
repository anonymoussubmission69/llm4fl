"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testReflectionObjectArray` is designed to test the behavior of the `ToStringBuilder` class when dealing with an array that contains null values and an integer array.\n2. The failure occurs in the assertion that checks if the expected string representation of the object matches the actual output. The expected output is `<null>`, but the actual output is `{}`.\n3. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method, which is called after the assertion that failed.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`appendDetail(StringBuffer, String, Object)`**: This method is responsible for appending details of an object to a StringBuffer. If it does not handle null values correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n- **`reflectionAppendArray(Object)`**: This method is responsible for appending array details. If it does not handle null arrays correctly, it could also lead to the failure.\n- **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail(StringBuffer, String, Object)`**: This method is responsible for appending details of an array. It is crucial to check how it handles null values and empty arrays.\n- **`appendNullText(StringBuffer, String)`**: This method appends a specific text for null values. If it is not called or does not function correctly, it could lead to the output being `{}` instead of `<null>`.\n- **`appendContentEnd(StringBuffer)`**: This method is responsible for appending the end of the content. If it does not handle the end of the string representation correctly, it could affect the final output.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 7, 29, 20]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the test failure."
