"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReflectionArrayCycle` is failing because it expected a `null` value but received an empty string representation `{}`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the `ReflectionToStringBuilder` is handling the array object, particularly in the `reflectionToString` method.\n\nThe stack trace points to the following methods as potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`reflectionAppendArray`** - This method is responsible for appending array details to the string buffer. If it does not handle cyclic references correctly, it could lead to the observed behavior.\n2. **`appendFieldsIn`** - This method is called when the class is an array and invokes `reflectionAppendArray`. It is crucial to check how it processes the fields of the array.\n3. **`toString`** - The `toString` method in `ReflectionToStringBuilder` is responsible for generating the final string representation. If it does not handle null or cyclic references properly, it could lead to the failure.\n4. **`getUpToClass`** - This method returns the class up to which reflection should be performed. If this is not set correctly, it could affect the output.\n5. **`getStyle`** - This method retrieves the style used for string representation. If the style is not set correctly, it could lead to unexpected results.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 7, 0, 22]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed test failure."
