"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testReflectionDoubleArrayArray` is designed to test the behavior of the `ReflectionToStringBuilder` class when handling a double array that includes null values and NaN.\n2. The failure occurs when the expected output is `<null>`, but the actual output is `{}`, indicating that the method responsible for converting the array to a string representation is not handling null values correctly.\n3. The stack trace points to the method `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` in the `ToStringBuilderTest` class, which suggests that this method is likely involved in the validation of how null values are represented in the string output.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`reflectionAppendArray(Object array)`**: This method is responsible for appending array details to the string buffer. It directly interacts with the array being tested.\n- **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail(StringBuffer buffer, String fieldName, Object array)`**: This method handles the details of appending the array to the string buffer, including how nulls are treated.\n- **`appendDetail(StringBuffer buffer, String fieldName, double[] array)`**: This method appends details for double arrays, which is relevant since the test involves a double array.\n- **`appendNullText(StringBuffer buffer, String fieldName)`**: This method is responsible for appending the text representation of null values, which is crucial for understanding why the output was `{}` instead of `<null>`.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 6, 14, 29]\n}\n```"
