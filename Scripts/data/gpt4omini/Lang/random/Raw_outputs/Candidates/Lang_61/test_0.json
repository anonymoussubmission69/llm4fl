"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testLang294` is attempting to delete all occurrences of the string `\"\\n%BLAH%\"` from a `StrBuilder` instance. \n2. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred in the `deleteImpl` method, which is called by the `deleteAll` method.\n3. The `deleteImpl` method uses `System.arraycopy`, which can throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the indices provided are out of bounds of the array.\n\nThe methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n- **`deleteAll(String str)`**: This method is responsible for initiating the deletion process and calls `deleteImpl`. It needs to be checked if it correctly calculates the indices for deletion.\n- **`indexOf(String str, int startIndex)`**: This method is used to find the index of the substring to be deleted. If it returns an incorrect index, it could lead to an out-of-bounds error in `deleteImpl`.\n- **`deleteImpl(int startIndex, int endIndex, int len)`**: This method directly performs the deletion using `System.arraycopy`. It is crucial to verify that the parameters passed to this method are valid and within bounds.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the suspicious methods are:\n\n1. `deleteAll(String str)` - Method ID: 0\n2. `indexOf(String str, int startIndex)` - Method ID: 1\n3. `deleteImpl(int startIndex, int endIndex, int len)` - Method ID: 2\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
