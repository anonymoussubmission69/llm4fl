"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testEscapedQuote_LANG_477` is failing due to an `OutOfMemoryError`, which indicates that there is likely an issue with how strings are being handled in the methods involved.\n2. The stack trace shows that the error occurs in the `appendQuotedString` method, which suggests that this method is indeed responsible for the excessive memory usage.\n3. The `applyPattern` method calls `appendQuotedString`, and if the pattern is malformed or if there is a logic error, it could lead to excessive memory allocation.\n4. The constructor of `ExtendedMessageFormat` calls `applyPattern`, which means it indirectly contributes to the problem if the pattern is not handled correctly.\n5. The other methods (`ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor with two parameters and `next` method) are less likely to cause memory issues.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- **For `appendQuotedString`:** Ensure that the method correctly handles the end of the string and does not enter an infinite loop. Add checks to prevent excessive appending if the pattern is malformed.\n  \n- **For `applyPattern`:** Validate the pattern before processing it. If the pattern is malformed, throw an exception or handle it gracefully to avoid calling `appendQuotedString` with an invalid pattern.\n\n- **For `ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor:** Ensure that the pattern passed to it is valid before calling `applyPattern`.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\n1. **Method ID 3 (`appendQuotedString`)** - Most suspicious due to direct involvement in memory allocation issues.\n2. **Method ID 1 (`applyPattern`)** - Second most suspicious as it calls `appendQuotedString`.\n3. **Method ID 2 (`ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor)** - Third, as it initializes the object and calls `applyPattern`.\n4. **Method ID 0 (`ExtendedMessageFormat` constructor with two parameters)** - Fourth, as it simply delegates to another constructor.\n5. **Method ID 4 (`next`)** - Least suspicious, as it is a simple utility function.\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
