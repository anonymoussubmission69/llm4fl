"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n### Method Analysis\n\n1. **Method ID 0: `getPackageName(String className)`**\n   - **Issues**:\n     - The method does not handle the case when `className` is `null` properly. The check for `null` is placed after trying to find the last index of the package separator, which will lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n     - The logic for extracting the package name is flawed. If `className` is not `null` but does not contain the package separator, it will throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to call `substring(0, i)`.\n   - **Potential Fix**:\n     ```java\n     public static String getPackageName(String className) {\n         if (className == null) {\n             return \"\"; // Return empty string for null class names\n         }\n         int i = className.lastIndexOf(PACKAGE_SEPARATOR_CHAR);\n         if (i == -1) {\n             return \"\"; // Return empty string if no package separator is found\n         }\n         return className.substring(0, i);\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Method ID 1: `getPackageName(Class<?> cls)`**\n   - **Issues**:\n     - The method checks for `null` but does not return immediately, leading to a potential `NullPointerException` when calling `cls.getName()`.\n     - It relies on the first method for package extraction, which has its own issues.\n   - **Potential Fix**:\n     ```java\n     public static String getPackageName(Class<?> cls) {\n         if (cls == null) {\n             return \"\"; // Return empty string for null class\n         }\n         return getPackageName(cls.getName());\n     }\n     ```\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods\nGiven the analysis, the first method (`getPackageName(String className)`) has more critical issues that could lead to exceptions, while the second method (`getPackageName(Class<?> cls)`) is dependent on the first but has a simpler fix. Therefore, the re-ranking is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
