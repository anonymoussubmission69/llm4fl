"Based on the analysis of the test case and the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n### Method Analysis\n\n1. **Method ID 0: `containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars)`**\n   - The method checks if the `CharSequence` contains none of the characters in the `invalidChars` string. \n   - The test case indicates that it expected `true` but received `false`, suggesting that the method may not be correctly identifying the presence of invalid characters, especially with supplementary characters.\n   - The method currently has a fallback to convert `invalidChars` to a character array, which may not handle certain edge cases correctly.\n\n2. **Method ID 1: `containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**\n   - This method checks if the `CharSequence` contains none of the characters in the `searchChars` array.\n   - The nested loops could lead to performance issues or incorrect comparisons, but it is less directly implicated in the test failure.\n   - The method has a logical error where the `return true;` statement is incorrectly placed inside the loop, which will never be reached if the first character matches.\n\n### Suggested Fixes\n\n1. **For Method ID 0:**\n   - Ensure that the method correctly handles supplementary characters by checking the character encoding and possibly using a more robust method to check for character presence.\n   - Example fix:\n     ```java\n     public static boolean containsNone(CharSequence cs, String invalidChars) {\n         if (cs == null || invalidChars == null) {\n             return true; // or handle as needed\n         }\n         for (int i = 0; i < cs.length(); i++) {\n             if (invalidChars.indexOf(cs.charAt(i)) >= 0) {\n                 return false;\n             }\n         }\n         return true;\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **For Method ID 1:**\n   - Correct the placement of the `return true;` statement to ensure it is only reached if no characters match.\n   - Example fix:\n     ```java\n     public static boolean containsNone(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {\n         if (cs == null || searchChars == null) {\n             return true; // or handle as needed\n         }\n         int csLen = cs.length();\n         int searchLen = searchChars.length;\n         for (int i = 0; i < csLen; i++) {\n             char ch = cs.charAt(i);\n             for (int j = 0; j < searchLen; j++) {\n                 if (searchChars[j] == ch) {\n                     return false;\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n         return true; // This should be outside the loop\n     }\n     ```\n\n### Re-Ranking\n\nGiven the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n- **Method ID 0** is still the most suspicious due to the direct failure in the test case.\n- **Method ID 1** is less suspicious but still needs attention due to potential logical errors.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
