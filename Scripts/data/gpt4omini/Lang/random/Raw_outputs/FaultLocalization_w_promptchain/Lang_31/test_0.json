"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test is failing because the expected result was `false`, but the actual result was `true`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsAny` is likely not functioning as intended when it comes to handling supplementary characters.\n\nHere\u2019s the analysis of the methods:\n\n1. **Method 0: `containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`**\n   - This method is responsible for checking if any characters from `searchChars` are present in `cs`. The test case indicates that it is not correctly identifying when none of the characters are present, especially with supplementary characters involved. This method is directly related to the failure in the test case, making it the most suspicious.\n\n2. **Method 3: `containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**\n   - This method is a variant of the previous one, checking for characters in a `char[]` instead of a `String`. It also calls `isEmpty` to check for empty inputs. Since it is closely related to the first method and could be invoked by it, it is also suspicious, but slightly less so than Method 0.\n\n3. **Method 1: `isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`**\n   - This method checks if a `CharSequence` is empty or null. While it is a utility method, it is not directly responsible for the failure in the test case. However, if it incorrectly identifies a non-empty sequence as empty, it could lead to issues in the `containsAny` methods. Thus, it is ranked lower in suspicion.\n\n4. **Method 2: `isEmpty(char[] array)`**\n   - Similar to Method 1, this method checks if a `char[]` is empty or null. It is the least suspicious because it does not directly interact with the failing test case. It is a utility method that is less likely to be the source of the problem.\n\nHere is the JSON output ranking the methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if any characters from 'searchChars' are present in 'cs'.

It is the least suspicious as it does not directly interact with the failing test case.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
