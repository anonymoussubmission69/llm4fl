"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. The test is failing because the expected numerator is 1, but the actual result is 100. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the `reduce()` method or the `getFraction()` method, as these methods are responsible for creating and reducing fractions.\n\n2. The `reduce()` method is supposed to simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). If the GCD is not calculated correctly, or if the reduction logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. The `greatestCommonDivisor()` method is crucial for the `reduce()` method to function correctly. If it does not return the correct GCD, the fraction will not be reduced properly.\n\n4. The `getFraction()` method is responsible for creating the fraction object. If it does not handle the input values correctly, it could lead to incorrect fraction creation, which would affect the subsequent reduction.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The reduce() method is responsible for simplifying the fraction.
