"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'replaceEach' is responsible for replacing occurrences of substrings in a given text. The stack trace indicates a NullPointerException occurring within this method, suggesting that it does not handle null values properly, especially when the searchList or replacementList contains null elements. This is a critical issue since the test cases are specifically designed to check for null safety.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The overloaded 'replaceEach' method is a public static method that calls the private version of 'replaceEach'. While it does not directly show any issues in the stack trace, it is still suspicious because it is the entry point for the test cases. If the input parameters are not validated properly before calling the private method, it could lead to the same NullPointerException. However, it is less suspicious than the private method since it delegates the actual logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    }\n]\n```"
