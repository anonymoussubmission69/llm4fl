"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail' is responsible for appending the details of an array to a StringBuffer.

This suggests that the method may not be handling null arrays correctly, leading to the unexpected output.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArray' calls 'reflectionAppendArrayDetail' and passes the array to it.
