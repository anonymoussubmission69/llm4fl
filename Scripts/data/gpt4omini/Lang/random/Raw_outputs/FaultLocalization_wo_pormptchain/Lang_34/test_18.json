"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 21,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'toString()' in 'ReflectionToStringBuilder' is responsible for generating the string representation of the object. The test failure indicates that the expected output was null, but the actual output was '{}'. This suggests that the logic in this method may not be handling the case of cyclic references correctly, leading to an incorrect string representation.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'reflectionAppendArray(Object array)' is called to handle array objects. Since the test involves an array that references itself, this method's implementation could be a source of the issue if it does not properly handle cyclic references.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'appendFieldsIn(Class<?> clazz)' is responsible for appending fields of the class to the string representation. If it does not correctly handle arrays or cyclic references, it could lead to the observed failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getUpToClass()' returns the class up to which reflection should be performed. If this is not set correctly, it could affect the behavior of the reflection methods, potentially leading to incorrect output.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
