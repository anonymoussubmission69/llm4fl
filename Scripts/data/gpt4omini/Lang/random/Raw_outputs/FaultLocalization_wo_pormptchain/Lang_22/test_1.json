"Based on the information gathered from the test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)' is responsible for reducing fractions. The test case that failed indicates an issue with the expected output of this method when handling extreme values, particularly with Integer.MIN_VALUE. The test expected a different result than what was returned, suggesting a potential flaw in the logic for handling edge cases.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)' is used within 'getReducedFraction' to simplify the fraction. If there is an issue with how the GCD is calculated, it could lead to incorrect results in the reduced fraction. This method is suspicious as it directly impacts the output of the main method being tested.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of the Fraction class initializes the numerator and denominator. While it is less likely to be the source of the fault, any issues in how these values are set could potentially lead to incorrect behavior in the methods that rely on them. However, it is less suspicious compared to the methods that perform calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getDenominator()' simply returns the denominator value. It is unlikely to be the source of the fault since it does not perform any calculations or logic that could lead to an error. Thus, it is the least suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Similar to 'getDenominator()', the method 'getNumerator()' returns the numerator value without any processing. It is not likely to be the cause of the failure, making it the least suspicious method.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
