    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testReflectionIntArrayArray` is designed to test the behavior of the `ToStringBuilder` class when handling arrays, particularly with null values.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an assertion failed because the expected output was `<null>`, but the actual output was `{}`. This suggests that the method responsible for converting the array to a string representation did not handle the null value correctly.\n3. The methods covered by the failed test include several methods from the `ReflectionToStringBuilder` and `ToStringStyle` classes, which are responsible for generating string representations of objects and arrays.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`reflectionAppendArray`** (method_id: 1): This method is responsible for appending array details to the string buffer. It directly interacts with the array being tested.\n2. **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail`** (method_id: 6): This method handles the details of appending array elements, including null handling. It is crucial to check how it processes null values.\n3. **`appendFieldsIn`** (method_id: 4): This method checks if the class is an array and calls `reflectionAppendArray`. It is important to see how it determines the type and handles arrays.\n4. **`appendStart`** (method_id: 5): This method starts the appending process and may influence how the output is formatted.\n5. **`appendEnd`** (method_id: 11): This method finalizes the appending process and may also affect the output.\n6. **`toString`** (method_id: 22): This method is responsible for generating the final string representation of the object, and it may not be handling nulls correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 5, 6, 11, 22]\n}\n```"
