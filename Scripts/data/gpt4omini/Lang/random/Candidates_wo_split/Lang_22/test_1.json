    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testReducedFactory_int_int` is testing the `getReducedFraction` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is designed to check various scenarios including zero, normal fractions, improper fractions, negative fractions, and edge cases like zero denominators and extreme values.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that there is an `AssertionFailedError` occurring at line 336 of the `FractionTest` class, which suggests that the expected value does not match the actual value returned by the method being tested.\n\n3. The `getReducedFraction` method is the primary suspect as it is directly involved in the test cases that are failing. The method includes logic for handling zero denominators, which is critical since the test cases are explicitly checking for this condition.\n\n4. The constructor of the `Fraction` class is also covered, but it is less likely to be the source of the fault since the test cases are primarily focused on the behavior of `getReducedFraction`.\n\n5. The `greatestCommonDivisor` method is called within `getReducedFraction`, and any issues with the GCD calculation could potentially lead to incorrect results in the fraction reduction process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n- `getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)` - Method ID: 1\n- `greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)` - Method ID: 4\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4]\n}\n```"
