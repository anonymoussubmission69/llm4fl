    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBigDecimal` is failing due to an assertion that checks the equality of two `BigDecimal` objects using the `EqualsBuilder`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `assertTrue` method, which suggests that the equality check performed by `EqualsBuilder` is returning false when it should return true.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed for potential faults are:\n\n1. **`isEquals()`**: This method returns the value of the `isEquals` variable. If this variable is not set correctly during the equality checks, it could lead to incorrect results.\n   \n2. **`append(Object lhs, Object rhs)`**: This method is responsible for appending two objects for comparison. The logic within this method determines how equality is assessed, and any issues in this logic could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\n3. **`EqualsBuilder()`**: The constructor initializes the `EqualsBuilder` object. While it may not directly cause the failure, it is important to ensure that the initial state of the object is set correctly.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods that need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
