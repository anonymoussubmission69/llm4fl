    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAny_StringWithBadSupplementaryChars` is designed to check the behavior of the `StringUtils.containsAny` method when dealing with supplementary characters. The test fails because it expected `false` but received `true`, indicating that there is likely a fault in the logic of the `containsAny` method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`\n2. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`\n3. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`\n4. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`\n\nAmong these methods, the most suspicious ones are:\n\n- `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`: This method is directly involved in the test and is likely where the fault originates.\n- `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`: This method is also related to the `containsAny` functionality and may be called within the first method.\n- `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`: This method checks if the input is empty, which could affect the logic in `containsAny`.\n- `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`: This method checks if the character array is empty, which is also relevant to the `containsAny` logic.\n\nGiven the context, the following methods are ranked as suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3, 2, 1]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0 corresponds to `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`.\n- Method ID 3 corresponds to `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`.\n- Method ID 2 corresponds to `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`.\n- Method ID 1 corresponds to `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`. \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
