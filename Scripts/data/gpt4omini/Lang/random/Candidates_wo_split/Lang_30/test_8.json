    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsNone_CharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing because the expected result of `StringUtils.containsNone` is `true`, but it is returning `false`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `containsNone` method of the `StringUtils` class.\n\nThe covered method identified is:\n- `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils:containsNone(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;[C)Z` (method_id: 0)\n\nThis method is responsible for checking if a given `CharSequence` contains none of the characters in the provided char array. The failure suggests that the logic within this method may not be correctly handling the edge cases related to supplementary characters, which are being tested in the failing test case.\n\nGiven this information, the suspicious method that needs to be analyzed further is the `containsNone` method.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0]\n}\n```"
