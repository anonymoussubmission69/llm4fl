    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyStringWithSupplementaryChars` is designed to check the behavior of the `StringUtils.containsAny` method when dealing with supplementary characters. The test fails when it expects `false` but receives `true`, indicating that there is likely a fault in the logic of the `containsAny` method.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`\n3. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`\n4. `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`\n\nThe most suspicious method is `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)` because it is directly involved in the failing assertion. The method `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)` is also relevant as it is called within the first method. The `isEmpty` methods are less likely to be the source of the fault but should still be considered as they are part of the logic flow.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 3]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID `0` corresponds to `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`, which is directly related to the failure.\n- Method ID `3` corresponds to `StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`, which is called within the first method and could influence its behavior."
