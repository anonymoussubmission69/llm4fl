"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n1. **`deleteAll(String str)`**: This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for deleting all occurrences of a specified string. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred, which suggests that there may be an issue with how indices are managed within this method.\n\n2. **`deleteImpl(int startIndex, int endIndex, int len)`**: This method is called by `deleteAll` and is responsible for the actual deletion of characters from the buffer. The exception could be related to how the `System.arraycopy` method is used, particularly if the indices are not correctly calculated.\n\n3. **`indexOf(String str, int startIndex)`**: This method is used within `deleteAll` to find the index of the string to be deleted. If it returns an incorrect index (e.g., a negative value or an index that exceeds the buffer size), it could lead to the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in `deleteImpl`.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 0**: `deleteAll(String str)` - Directly involved in the test and likely the source of the issue.\n- **Method ID 1**: `indexOf(String str, int startIndex)` - Used to find indices for deletion, which could lead to incorrect values.\n- **Method ID 2**: `deleteImpl(int startIndex, int endIndex, int len)` - Responsible for the actual deletion and could be where the exception is thrown if indices are incorrect."
