"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test method `testReduce()` is testing the `reduce()` method of the `Fraction` class. The test is failing at the assertion that checks if the denominator of the reduced fraction is equal to 1, but it is returning 100 instead. This indicates that there might be an issue in the `reduce()` method or in the way fractions are being created.\n\n2. The `reduce()` method calls `greatestCommonDivisor()` to simplify the fraction. If the GCD is not calculated correctly, it could lead to incorrect results in the `reduce()` method.\n\n3. The `getFraction()` method is responsible for creating instances of `Fraction`. If there is an issue in how fractions are instantiated (e.g., incorrect handling of negative values or zero denominators), it could lead to unexpected behavior in the `reduce()` method.\n\n4. The `getNumerator()` and `getDenominator()` methods are used to retrieve the values of the numerator and denominator, respectively. If these methods are returning incorrect values, it could also lead to assertion failures.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be investigated further:\n\n- `reduce()`\n- `greatestCommonDivisor()`\n- `getFraction()`\n- `getNumerator()`\n- `getDenominator()`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 1, 5, 0, 4]\n}\n```"
