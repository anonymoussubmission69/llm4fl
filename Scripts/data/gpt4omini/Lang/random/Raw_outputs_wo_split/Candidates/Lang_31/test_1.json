"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAnyCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because it expected `false` but received `true`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsAny` is likely not functioning as intended when checking for characters in the provided character arrays.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`**: This method checks if a `CharSequence` is empty or null. If this method incorrectly identifies a non-empty sequence as empty, it could lead to unexpected behavior in `containsAny`.\n\n2. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`**: This method checks if a character array is empty or null. Similar to `isEmpty`, if it incorrectly identifies a non-empty array as empty, it could affect the logic in `containsAny`.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**: This is the primary method being tested. The logic within this method is crucial, as it iterates through the characters of `cs` and checks if any of them match the characters in `searchChars`. If there is a flaw in this logic, it could lead to the test failing.\n\nGiven the context, the methods that are suspicious and need further analysis are:\n\n- `StringUtils.containsAny`\n- `StringUtils.isEmpty`\n- `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
