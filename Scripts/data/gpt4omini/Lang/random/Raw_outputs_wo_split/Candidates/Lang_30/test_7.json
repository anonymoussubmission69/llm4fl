"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAnyBut_StringStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because the expected value (2) does not match the actual value (3) returned by the method `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `indexOfAnyBut` method.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs during the assertion of the expected value, which directly points to the `indexOfAnyBut` method. The method `isEmpty` is also covered in the test, but it is a simple check for null or empty strings and is less likely to be the source of the fault.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n1. `indexOfAnyBut` - This method is directly involved in the test and is returning an unexpected value.\n2. `isEmpty` - While it is less likely to be the source of the fault, it is still part of the logic in `indexOfAnyBut` and should be reviewed to ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1]\n}\n```"
