"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testContainsAny_StringCharArrayWithBadSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected `false` but received `true`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.containsAny` is likely not handling the input as expected, particularly with respect to supplementary characters.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.containsAny`**: This method is directly involved in the test and is responsible for checking if any characters from a given array are present in a `CharSequence`. The failure suggests that it may not be correctly identifying the presence of characters, especially supplementary characters.\n\n2. **`StringUtils.isEmpty`**: This method is called within `containsAny` to check if the `CharSequence` or the search character array is empty. If it incorrectly identifies an empty input, it could lead to unexpected behavior in `containsAny`.\n\n3. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty`**: This method is also called within `containsAny` to check if the search character array is empty. Similar to `isEmpty`, if it fails to correctly identify an empty array, it could affect the logic in `containsAny`.\n\nGiven the context of the failure and the methods involved, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 1, 0]  // containsAny, isEmpty (CharSequence), isEmpty (char[])\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 2**: `StringUtils.containsAny` - Directly related to the failure.\n- **Method ID 1**: `StringUtils.isEmpty` - Affects the logic in `containsAny`.\n- **Method ID 0**: `ArrayUtils.isEmpty` - Also affects the logic in `containsAny`."
