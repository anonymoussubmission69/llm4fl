"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAny_StringCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected a value of `2` but received `0`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.indexOfAny` is likely not functioning as expected when handling the provided inputs.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence, char[])`**: This is the primary method being tested. The failure suggests that it is not correctly identifying the index of the character in the provided `CharSequence`.\n\n2. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[])`**: This method checks if the provided character array is empty. If this method returns `true`, it could lead to incorrect behavior in `indexOfAny`.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence)`**: Similar to `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`, this method checks if the `CharSequence` is empty. If it returns `true`, it could also affect the outcome of `indexOfAny`.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the most suspicious method is `StringUtils.indexOfAny`, as it is directly involved in the assertion that failed. The other two methods, `ArrayUtils.isEmpty` and `StringUtils.isEmpty`, are also relevant as they are called within `indexOfAny` and could influence its behavior.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 0**: `StringUtils.indexOfAny` - Directly responsible for the failure.\n- **Method ID 1**: `ArrayUtils.isEmpty` - Could affect the logic in `indexOfAny`.\n- **Method ID 2**: `StringUtils.isEmpty` - Also could affect the logic in `indexOfAny`."
