"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAny_StringStringWithSupplementaryChars` is failing due to an assertion that expected a value of `2` but received `0`. This indicates that the method `StringUtils.indexOfAny` is not returning the expected index for the character search.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed for potential faults are:\n\n1. **`StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars)`**: This is the primary method being tested. The failure indicates that it is not correctly identifying the index of the character in the provided sequence.\n\n2. **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[] array)`**: This method checks if the character array is empty. If it incorrectly returns `true`, it could lead to the main method returning `0` prematurely.\n\n3. **`StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence cs, String searchChars)`**: This method converts the string to a character array and calls the first `indexOfAny` method. If there is an issue in this conversion or the subsequent call, it could propagate the fault.\n\n4. **`StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence cs)`**: This method checks if the character sequence is empty. If it incorrectly identifies a non-empty sequence as empty, it could also lead to the main method returning `0`.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be investigated further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in any of them could lead to the failure observed in the test."
