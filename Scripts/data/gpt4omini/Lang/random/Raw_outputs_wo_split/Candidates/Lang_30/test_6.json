"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testIndexOfAnyBut_StringCharArrayWithSupplementaryChars` is failing because the expected value (2) does not match the actual value (3) returned by the method `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`. This indicates that there is likely an issue within the `indexOfAnyBut` method or its dependencies.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `ArrayUtils.isEmpty(char[])`\n2. `StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence)`\n3. `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut(CharSequence, char[])`\n\n### Analysis of Suspicious Methods:\n- **`StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`**: This is the primary method being tested. The failure indicates that the logic within this method may not be correctly handling the input, especially with supplementary characters.\n- **`ArrayUtils.isEmpty`**: This method is called within `indexOfAnyBut` to check if the `searchChars` array is empty. If this check fails, it could lead to incorrect behavior in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n- **`StringUtils.isEmpty`**: This method checks if the `CharSequence` is empty or null. If this check fails, it could also lead to incorrect behavior in `indexOfAnyBut`.\n\nGiven that the failure is related to the index being returned, the most suspicious method is `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut`, but the other two methods are also relevant as they are part of the control flow.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0: `ArrayUtils.isEmpty`\n- Method ID 1: `StringUtils.isEmpty`\n- Method ID 2: `StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut` \n\nThese methods should be examined to determine if they are contributing to the failure of the test."
