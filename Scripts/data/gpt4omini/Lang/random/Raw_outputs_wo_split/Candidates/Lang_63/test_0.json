"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testJiraLang281` is failing due to an assertion that expected the result of `DurationFormatUtils.formatPeriod` to be \"09\", but it returned \"-2\". This indicates that there is likely an issue in the calculation of the period between the two dates provided.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious due to their involvement in the formatting and calculation of the duration:\n\n1. **`formatPeriod(long startMillis, long endMillis, String format)`** - This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for formatting the period between two timestamps.\n2. **`formatPeriod(long startMillis, long endMillis, String format, boolean padWithZeros, TimeZone timezone)`** - This method is called within the previous method and handles the actual formatting logic, including the calculation of the duration.\n3. **`lexx(String format)`** - This method is responsible for parsing the format string and generating tokens, which are used in the formatting process.\n4. **`reduceAndCorrect(Calendar start, Calendar end, int field, int difference)`** - This method is used to adjust the values of the start and end calendars, which could affect the final duration calculation.\n5. **`containsTokenWithValue(Token[] tokens, Object value)`** - This method checks if a specific token exists, which could influence how the formatting is applied based on the tokens generated.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, it is essential to analyze these methods to identify where the logic may be incorrect or where the values may not be calculated as expected.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 5, 0, 4, 6]\n}\n```"
