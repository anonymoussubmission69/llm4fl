"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReflectionBooleanArrayArray` is failing due to an assertion that expected a null value but received an empty object representation instead. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method, which is called within the test.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ReflectionToStringBuilder` and `ToStringStyle` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious as they are involved in the process of converting objects to string representations, which is central to the test's purpose:\n\n1. **`reflectionAppendArray(Object array)`** - This method is responsible for appending array details to the string representation. If it does not handle null arrays correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n2. **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail(StringBuffer buffer, String fieldName, Object array)`** - This method appends details of the array to the buffer. If it does not correctly handle null values, it could also be a source of the issue.\n3. **`appendNullText(StringBuffer buffer, String fieldName)`** - This method appends a specific text for null values. If it is not invoked correctly or does not function as expected, it could lead to the failure.\n4. **`validateNullToStringStyleRegistry()`** - This method is directly mentioned in the stack trace and is likely responsible for validating how null values are represented. Its implementation should be closely examined.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are identified as potentially suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 6, 29, 586]\n}\n```\n\n- **Method ID 1**: `reflectionAppendArray(Object array)`\n- **Method ID 6**: `reflectionAppendArrayDetail(StringBuffer buffer, String fieldName, Object array)`\n- **Method ID 29**: `appendNullText(StringBuffer buffer, String fieldName)`\n- **Method ID 586**: `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry()` (from the test stack trace)\n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to determine if they are contributing to the failure of the test."
