"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReflectionFloatArray` is failing due to an assertion that checks if a null array is represented as `<null>`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method, which is called after the assertion for the null array.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ToStringStyle` and `ReflectionToStringBuilder` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`ToStringStyle:appendDetail`** - This method appends the value to a buffer. If the value is null, it may not handle it correctly.\n2. **`ReflectionToStringBuilder:reflectionAppendArray`** - This method is responsible for appending array details. If it does not handle null arrays properly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n3. **`ToStringStyle:reflectionAppendArrayDetail`** - This method appends details of an array, and if it does not account for null values correctly, it could cause the test to fail.\n4. **`ToStringStyle:appendNullText`** - This method is likely responsible for appending a specific representation for null values. If it is not invoked or does not function correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n5. **`ToStringBuilder:toString`** - This method converts the object to a string representation. If it does not handle null objects correctly, it could also be a source of the issue.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and the failure in the test could propagate through these methods, leading to the incorrect representation of the null array.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 7, 14, 15]\n}\n```"
