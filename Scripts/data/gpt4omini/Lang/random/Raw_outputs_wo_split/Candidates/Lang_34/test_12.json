"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testReflectionDoubleArray` is failing due to an assertion that expected a null value but received an empty object representation instead. The relevant part of the stack trace indicates that the failure occurred in the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method, which is likely related to how null values are handled in the `ToStringBuilder` class.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `ToStringStyle` and `ReflectionToStringBuilder` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`appendDetail`** (Method ID: 0) - This method appends the value to the buffer, which could be related to how null values are represented.\n2. **`reflectionAppendArray`** (Method ID: 2) - This method is responsible for appending array details, which is relevant since the test involves an array.\n3. **`reflectionAppendArrayDetail`** (Method ID: 7) - This method handles the details of appending array elements, including null handling.\n4. **`appendStart`** (Method ID: 6) - This method starts the appending process and may influence how the initial state is set up.\n5. **`appendEnd`** (Method ID: 12) - This method finalizes the appending process and may also affect how null values are treated.\n6. **`isRegistered`** (Method ID: 4) - This method checks if an object is registered, which could be relevant for null handling.\n7. **`getRegistry`** (Method ID: 26) - This method retrieves the registry of objects, which may be involved in the null handling logic.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and may propagate the issue of how null values are represented in the output. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 12, 26]\n}\n```"
