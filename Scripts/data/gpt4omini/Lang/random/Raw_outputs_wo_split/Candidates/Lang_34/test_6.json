"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testReflectionObjectArray` is designed to test the behavior of the `ToStringBuilder` class when handling arrays, particularly when one of the elements is `null`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `AssertionFailedError` occurred because the expected output was `<null>`, but the actual output was `{}`. This suggests that the method responsible for converting the array to a string representation did not handle the `null` value correctly.\n3. The methods involved in the conversion process include those related to appending details of the array and handling null values.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 7**: `reflectionAppendArrayDetail` - This method is responsible for appending details of an array, and it directly deals with the array elements, including nulls.\n- **Method ID 4**: `isRegistered` - This method checks if an object is registered, which might affect how nulls are handled.\n- **Method ID 29**: `appendNullText` - This method appends a specific text for null values, which is crucial for the expected output.\n- **Method ID 3**: `removeLastFieldSeparator` - This method might be involved in formatting the output string and could affect the final representation.\n- **Method ID 1**: `getUpToClass` - This method might influence the behavior of the reflection process, although it seems less directly related to the null handling.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 3, 4, 7, 29]\n}\n```"
