"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testReflectionIntArray` is designed to test the behavior of converting an integer array to a string representation using reflection. The test fails when it expects a null representation but receives an empty object representation instead.\n\n2. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `validateNullToStringStyleRegistry` method, which is called after the assertion that checks for null. This suggests that the issue may be related to how null values are handled in the `ToStringBuilder` or `ToStringStyle` classes.\n\n3. The covered methods include various methods from `ToStringStyle` and `ReflectionToStringBuilder`, which are responsible for building string representations of objects. The methods that are most relevant to the failure include those that handle null values and array representations.\n\n### Suspicious Methods\nThe following methods are identified as suspicious and need further analysis:\n\n- **Method ID 7**: `reflectionAppendArrayDetail` - This method is responsible for appending details of an array, including handling null values. It is crucial to check how it processes null arrays.\n  \n- **Method ID 4**: `isRegistered` - This method checks if an object is registered in the style registry. It may affect how null values are treated.\n\n- **Method ID 14**: `register` - This method registers an object in the style registry. If null handling is not correctly implemented here, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n- **Method ID 28**: `unregister` - Similar to `register`, this method may affect the state of the registry and how nulls are managed.\n\n- **Method ID 22**: `toString` - This method is responsible for generating the string representation of an object. It may need to be checked for how it handles null objects.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods identified for further analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [7, 4, 14, 28, 22]\n}\n```"
