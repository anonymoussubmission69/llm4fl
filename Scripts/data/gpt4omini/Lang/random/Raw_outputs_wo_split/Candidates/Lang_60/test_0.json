"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testLang295` is failing due to an assertion that checks if the `contains` method of the `StrBuilder` class is functioning correctly. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when the `contains` method is called, which suggests that there may be an issue with how this method is implemented.\n\nThe test also calls the `deleteFirst` method, which internally uses the `indexOf` method. Therefore, both `deleteFirst` and `indexOf` are also relevant to the failure. The methods that need to be analyzed for potential faults are:\n\n1. `contains(char ch)` - This method is directly involved in the failure.\n2. `indexOf(String str, int startIndex)` - This method is called by `deleteFirst`, which is part of the test.\n3. `deleteFirst(String str)` - This method is called in the test and may affect the state of the `StrBuilder` object.\n4. `deleteImpl(int startIndex, int endIndex, int len)` - This method is used by `deleteFirst` and could also be a source of issues if it does not handle the buffer correctly.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the suspicious methods that need further analysis are:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4]\n}\n```"
