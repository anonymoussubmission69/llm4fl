"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testEscapedQuote_LANG_477` is designed to test the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class, specifically its ability to format a string with escaped quotes.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `OutOfMemoryError` occurred, which suggests that there may be an issue with how strings are being handled or constructed within the methods of the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include constructors and methods that manipulate strings, such as `appendQuotedString` and `applyPattern`.\n\nThe covered methods that need to be analyzed for potential faults are:\n\n- **Method ID 0**: `ExtendedMessageFormat(String pattern, Map registry)` - This constructor initializes the object and calls another constructor.\n- **Method ID 1**: `applyPattern(String pattern)` - This method is responsible for applying the pattern and may be where the string manipulation is causing excessive memory usage.\n- **Method ID 2**: `ExtendedMessageFormat(String pattern, Locale locale, Map registry)` - This constructor also applies the pattern and could be linked to the memory issue.\n- **Method ID 3**: `appendQuotedString(String pattern, ParsePosition pos, StringBuffer appendTo, boolean escapingOn)` - This method handles appending quoted strings and could be a source of the memory issue if it leads to excessive string building.\n- **Method ID 4**: `next(ParsePosition pos)` - While this method is simple, it is part of the string parsing process and could indirectly contribute to the problem.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n```"
