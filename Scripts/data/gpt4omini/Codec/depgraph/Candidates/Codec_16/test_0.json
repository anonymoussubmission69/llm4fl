    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testCodec200` is designed to test the `Base32` codec, specifically its constructor that takes a boolean and a byte as parameters.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to the pad byte being in the alphabet or whitespace. This exception is raised in the constructor of the `Base32` class.\n3. The constructor `Base32(final boolean useHex, final byte pad)` calls another constructor `Base32(final int lineLength, final byte[] lineSeparator, final boolean useHex, final byte pad)`, which contains the logic that checks if the pad is valid.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 1**: `Base32(final boolean useHex, final byte pad)` - This method is directly involved in the test and is the entry point for the constructor that leads to the exception.\n- **Method ID 0**: `Base32(final int lineLength, final byte[] lineSeparator, final boolean useHex, final byte pad)` - This method contains the logic that checks the validity of the pad and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **Method ID 4**: `isInAlphabet(final byte octet)` - This method is called within the constructor to check if the pad is in the alphabet, which is directly related to the exception being thrown.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 4]\n}\n```"
