"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method ID 0**: This method directly checks the `pad` parameter and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is in the alphabet or whitespace. This is the direct cause of the test failure, making it the most suspicious method.\n\n2. **Method ID 1**: This method calls the main constructor and passes the `pad` parameter. If the `pad` is invalid, it will propagate the exception from the main constructor. While it is suspicious, it is less so than Method ID 0 because it does not perform the check itself.\n\n3. **Method ID 4**: This method checks if a byte is in the alphabet but does not throw exceptions itself. It is a utility method and does not directly relate to the test failure, making it the least suspicious.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- **Method ID 0**: Ensure that the `pad` parameter is validated before being passed to the constructor. If the `pad` is invalid, provide a more descriptive error message or handle it gracefully.\n  \n- **Method ID 1**: Consider adding validation for the `pad` parameter before calling the main constructor. This can prevent the propagation of the exception from the main constructor.\n\n- **Method ID 4**: No changes are necessary for this method as it is a utility method and does not directly contribute to the test failure.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\nAfter analyzing the methods and their roles in the test failure, the ranking remains the same as the original:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
