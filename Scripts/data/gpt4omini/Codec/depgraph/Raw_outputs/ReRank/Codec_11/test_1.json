"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method 0 (`decodeQuotedPrintable`)**: This method processes bytes and expects valid hexadecimal digits after an escape character. If the input does not conform to this expectation, it can lead to a `DecoderException`. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs when trying to decode a byte that is not a valid hexadecimal digit, making this method highly suspicious.\n\n2. **Method 1 (`digit16`)**: This method is responsible for validating hexadecimal digits. It throws a `DecoderException` if it receives an invalid byte, which is the exact error seen in the stack trace. This makes it very suspicious as well.\n\n3. **Method 2 (`decode(String pString)`)**: This method serves as a wrapper for decoding but does not directly handle the decoding logic that leads to the exception. It is less suspicious than the previous methods.\n\n4. **Method 3 (`decode(String pString, String charset)`)**: Similar to Method 2, this method is a higher-level function that does not directly contribute to the decoding failure. It is the least suspicious.\n\n### Potential Fixes:\n- **For Method 0 (`decodeQuotedPrintable`)**: Add validation to check if the byte after the escape character is a valid hexadecimal digit before calling `Utils.digit16()`. If it is not valid, throw a `DecoderException` with a descriptive message.\n\n- **For Method 1 (`digit16`)**: The method already throws a `DecoderException` for invalid input. Ensure that the input to this method is validated before calling it from `decodeQuotedPrintable`.\n\n- **For Method 2 and Method 3**: These methods can remain unchanged as they do not directly contribute to the issue.\n\n### Re-Ranking:\nGiven the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
