"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testCodec112` is attempting to encode a byte array using the `Base64.encodeBase64` method. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to the input array being too large for the specified maximum size.\n\n2. The exception occurs in the `Base64.encodeBase64` method, specifically when it checks if the length of the encoded output exceeds the maximum result size.\n\n3. The methods involved in the encoding process include:\n   - `Base64.encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)`\n   - `Base64.getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)`\n   - `Base64.encode(byte[] pArray)`\n   - `Base64.encode(byte[] in, int inPos, int inAvail)`\n\n4. The `getEncodeLength` method is responsible for calculating the length of the encoded output, which is crucial in determining if the output exceeds the maximum size.\n\n5. The `Base64.encode` methods are responsible for the actual encoding process and may also contribute to the issue if they do not handle the input correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be examined further:\n\n- `Base64.encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)` (method_id: 4)\n- `Base64.getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)` (method_id: 1)\n- `Base64.encode(byte[] pArray)` (method_id: 2)\n- `Base64.encode(byte[] in, int inPos, int inAvail)` (method_id: 0)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4]\n}\n```"
