"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testRfc4648Section10Encode` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output. The expected output is `\"Zg==\"`, but the actual output has an additional newline character, which suggests that there may be an issue with how the encoding is handled, particularly with line breaks.\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test include several encoding methods in the `Base64` class. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`encode(byte[] in, int inPos, int inAvail)`** - This method is responsible for the actual encoding process and may be where the newline character is being introduced.\n2. **`getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)`** - This method calculates the length of the encoded output and may influence how the output is structured, including line breaks.\n3. **`encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)`** - This method is a higher-level method that calls the encoding methods and may also be involved in how the data is processed.\n4. **`encodeBase64String(byte[] binaryData)`** - This method converts the encoded byte array to a string and may also be involved in how the final output is formatted.\n5. **`getBytesUtf8(String string)`** - This method is used to convert the input string to a byte array, and any issues here could propagate through the encoding process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the source of the newline character in the output."
