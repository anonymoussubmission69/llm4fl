"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSkipNotEncodedCRLF` is designed to test the `decode` method of the `QuotedPrintableCodec` class. The test fails due to a `DecoderException` indicating an invalid URL encoding, specifically that a character is not a valid digit in radix 16.\n\n2. The stack trace points to the `digit16` method in the `Utils` class, which is called from the `decodeQuotedPrintable` method in the `QuotedPrintableCodec` class. This suggests that the issue may originate from how the `decodeQuotedPrintable` method processes the input bytes.\n\n3. The `decode` method in `QuotedPrintableCodec` is also involved, as it calls `decodeQuotedPrintable`. Additionally, the `getBytesUsAscii` and `getBytesUnchecked` methods are part of the process of converting the input string to bytes, which could also be relevant.\n\n4. The methods that are directly involved in the failure are:\n   - `decodeQuotedPrintable(byte[])`\n   - `digit16(byte)`\n   - `decode(String)`\n   - `decode(String, String)`\n   - `decode(byte[])`\n\nGiven this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be examined further:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0: `decodeQuotedPrintable(byte[])` - This is where the exception is thrown.\n- Method ID 1: `digit16(byte)` - This method is responsible for converting a byte to a digit and throws the exception.\n- Method ID 2: `decode(String)` - This method is part of the decoding process.\n- Method ID 3: `decode(String, String)` - This method is also part of the decoding process.\n- Method ID 6: `decode(byte[])` - This method calls `decodeQuotedPrintable` and is part of the decoding workflow. \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure."
