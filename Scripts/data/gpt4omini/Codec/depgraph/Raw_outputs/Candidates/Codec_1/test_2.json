"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testLocaleIndependence` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` indicating that a character is not mapped. The stack trace points to the `fail` method in the `TestCase` class, which suggests that the issue arises during the encoding process in the `StringEncoder`.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `Soundex` and `SoundexUtils` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`SoundexUtils.clean(String str)`**: This method is responsible for cleaning the input string. If it does not handle certain characters correctly, it could lead to issues in the encoding process.\n\n2. **`Soundex.soundex(String str)`**: This method calls `SoundexUtils.clean` and processes the cleaned string. If the input string is not cleaned properly, it could lead to an incorrect mapping.\n\n3. **`Soundex.map(char ch)`**: This method maps characters to their corresponding Soundex values. The error message indicates that a character is not mapped, which suggests that this method may be failing to handle certain characters.\n\n4. **`Soundex.getMappingCode(String str, int index)`**: This method retrieves the mapping code for a character at a specific index. If the character is not mapped correctly, it could lead to the failure observed in the test.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 0**: `SoundexUtils.clean(String str)` - Responsible for cleaning the input string.\n- **Method ID 1**: `Soundex.soundex(String str)` - Processes the cleaned string.\n- **Method ID 2**: `Soundex.map(char ch)` - Maps characters to Soundex values, potentially failing for certain characters.\n- **Method ID 4**: `Soundex.getMappingCode(String str, int index)` - Retrieves the mapping code, which could lead to the failure if the character is not mapped."
