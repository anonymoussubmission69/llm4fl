"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBase64EmptyOutputStream` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` related to streaming base64 encoding. The test is likely checking the behavior of the `Base64OutputStream` when encoding an empty byte array.\n\nThe stack trace indicates that the failure occurs in the `testByteByByte` method, which is called from `testBase64EmptyOutputStream`. This suggests that the issue may be related to how the `Base64OutputStream` handles flushing and encoding of data.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `Base64OutputStream` and `Base64` classes. Here are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **flush(boolean propogate)** - This method is responsible for flushing the output stream and may not be handling the empty input correctly.\n2. **flush()** - This method calls the `flush(boolean)` method and could also be a point of failure.\n3. **close()** - This method encodes the last byte and flushes the output, which may not be handling the empty case properly.\n4. **Base64:encode(byte[], int, int)** - This method is responsible for encoding the byte array and may not be handling the empty array correctly.\n5. **Base64:avail()** - This method checks the available bytes and could be returning an incorrect value when the input is empty.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 11]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
