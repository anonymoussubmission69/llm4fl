"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testEndMb` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output. The test is checking the encoding of certain strings using the `checkEncodings` method, which internally calls the `encode` method of the `Caverphone` class.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the `checkEncoding` method, which is part of the `StringEncoderAbstractTest` class. The `checkEncoding` method is likely responsible for comparing the expected and actual results of the encoding process.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n1. `caverphone(String txt)`: This method performs the actual encoding logic and is the most likely source of the fault since it processes the input string and applies various transformations.\n2. `encode(String pString)`: This method simply calls the `caverphone` method, so it is also relevant as it is part of the call chain.\n3. The constructor `Caverphone()`: While this method initializes the object, it is less likely to be the source of the fault compared to the encoding methods.\n\nGiven this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. `caverphone(String txt)` - This method contains the core logic for encoding and is likely where the fault originates.\n2. `encode(String pString)` - This method is a direct call to `caverphone` and is part of the encoding process.\n\nThe constructor is not included in the list of suspicious methods since it does not contain any logic that would affect the encoding output.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 2]\n}\n```"
