"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testLocaleIndependence` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` indicating that the character '\u0130' is not mapped. This suggests that the issue lies in the character mapping logic of the methods involved in encoding strings, particularly with respect to locale-specific characters.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'map' is responsible for mapping characters to their corresponding soundex values. The failure indicates that the character '\u0130' is not being handled correctly, leading to an IllegalArgumentException. This suggests that the mapping logic is incomplete or incorrect for certain characters.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'soundex' method calls 'clean' and then attempts to map characters. If 'clean' does not handle locale-specific characters properly, it could lead to issues in this method. The fact that it relies on the mapping function makes it suspicious as well.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getMappingCode' method calls 'map' and checks the index. If the character is not mapped correctly, it could lead to issues in the overall encoding process. However, it is less suspicious than 'map' itself since it is more of a wrapper function.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'clean' method is responsible for cleaning the input string but does not directly deal with character mapping. While it may contribute to the overall process, it is the least suspicious in this context since the failure is related to mapping rather than cleaning.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
