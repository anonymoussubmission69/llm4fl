"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `testSoftLineBreakDecode` is failing due to a `DecoderException` indicating an invalid URL encoding. The stack trace points to the `digit16` method in the `Utils` class, which is called during the decoding process in the `decodeQuotedPrintable` method of the `QuotedPrintableCodec` class.\n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n\n1. **Method 0: `decodeQuotedPrintable(byte[] bytes)`**\n   - This method is responsible for decoding quoted-printable encoded byte arrays. It processes each byte and expects certain bytes to be preceded by an escape character. If the escape character is found, it attempts to read the next two bytes as hexadecimal digits using the `Utils.digit16` method.\n   - **Suspicion**: The method does not handle cases where the escape character is not followed by valid hexadecimal digits, which could lead to the `DecoderException` seen in the stack trace.\n\n2. **Method 1: `digit16(byte b)`**\n   - This method converts a byte to a hexadecimal digit. If the byte does not represent a valid hexadecimal digit, it throws a `DecoderException`.\n   - **Suspicion**: The exception thrown here is directly related to the failure in the test. If the input byte is not a valid hexadecimal digit, it will cause the decoding process to fail.\n\n3. **Method 2: `decode(String pString)`**\n   - This method is a higher-level decode function that calls another decode method with a default charset if the input string is null.\n   - **Suspicion**: This method is less suspicious as it primarily serves as a wrapper and does not directly handle the decoding logic that leads to the exception.\n\n4. **Method 3: `decode(String pString, String charset)`**\n   - Similar to Method 2, this method decodes a string using a specified charset. It also calls the `decode` method with a byte array.\n   - **Suspicion**: Like Method 2, this method is less suspicious as it does not directly contribute to the decoding failure.\n\n### Ranking of Methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The decodeQuotedPrintable method processes bytes and expects valid hexadecimal digits after an escape character.
