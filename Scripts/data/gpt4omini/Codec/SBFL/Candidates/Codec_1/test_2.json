    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testLocaleIndependence` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` indicating that a character is not mapped. The error occurs when the `encode` method of the `StringEncoder` is called, which likely involves the `Soundex` class methods.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`SoundexUtils.clean(String str)`**: This method is responsible for cleaning the input string. If it does not handle certain characters correctly, it could lead to issues in the encoding process.\n\n2. **`Soundex.encode(String pString)`**: This method calls the `soundex` method, which is central to the encoding process. Any issues here could directly affect the output.\n\n3. **`Soundex.getMappingCode(String str, int index)`**: This method retrieves the mapping code for a character. If the character is not mapped correctly, it could lead to the error observed.\n\n4. **`Soundex.map(char ch)`**: This method maps a character to its corresponding code. The error message indicates that a character (specifically '\u0130') is not mapped, which suggests that this method may not be handling certain characters properly.\n\n5. **`Soundex.soundex(String str)`**: This method is the main implementation of the Soundex algorithm. If there are issues in how it processes the input string, it could lead to the failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]\n}\n```"
