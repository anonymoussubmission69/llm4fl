The error indicates that the encoded string does not match the expected string, which suggests that there may be an issue with the encoding logic.\n\nThe following methods from the `QuotedPrintableCodec` class are relevant to the encoding process and should be analyzed for potential faults:\n\n1. **encode(byte[] bytes)** - This method is responsible for encoding byte arrays using quoted-printable encoding.\n2. **encode(String pString)** - This method encodes a string using the default charset.\n3. **encode(String pString, String charset)** - This method encodes a string using a specified charset.\n4. **encodeQuotedPrintable(BitSet printable, byte[] bytes)** - This method performs the actual quoted-printable encoding on the byte array.\n5. **encodeQuotedPrintable(int b, ByteArrayOutputStream buffer)** - This method encodes a single byte into its quoted-printable representation.\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the encoding process and are likely candidates for the source of the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 5, 6, 7, 9]\n}\n```"
