The test `testSoftLineBreakDecode` is designed to test the decoding functionality of the `QuotedPrintableCodec` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `DecoderException` was thrown due to an invalid URL encoding, specifically mentioning \"not a valid digit (radix 16): 13\". This suggests that there is an issue with how the decoding is handling certain byte values.\n3. The methods involved in the decoding process include `decode`, `decodeQuotedPrintable`, and `digit16`, which are critical in the decoding logic.\n\nThe covered methods that are potentially suspicious and need further analysis are:\n\n- `decode(String pString)` - This method is responsible for initiating the decoding process.\n- `decodeQuotedPrintable(byte[] bytes)` - This method performs the actual decoding of quoted-printable encoded bytes.\n- `digit16(byte b)` - This method converts a byte to a hexadecimal digit and throws a `DecoderException` if the byte is not a valid digit.\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n1. `QuotedPrintableCodec:decode(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 5)\n2. `QuotedPrintableCodec:decodeQuotedPrintable([B)[B` (method_id: 7)\n3. `Utils:digit16(B)I` (method_id: 8)\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the decoding process and are likely where the fault lies.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 7, 8]\n}\n```"
