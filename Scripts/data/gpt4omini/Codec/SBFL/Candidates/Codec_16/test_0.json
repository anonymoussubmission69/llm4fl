    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCodec200` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` that indicates the padding byte must not be in the alphabet or whitespace. The stack trace points to the constructor of the `Base32` class, specifically the line where the check for the padding byte occurs.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **Base32 Constructor with Padding** (`Base32:<init>(ZB)V`): This method is directly involved in the creation of the `Base32` object and is where the padding byte is passed. It delegates to another constructor, which is where the exception is thrown.\n\n2. **Base32 Constructor with Multiple Parameters** (`Base32:<init>(I[BZB)V`): This constructor contains the logic that checks if the padding byte is in the alphabet or whitespace, leading to the exception.\n\n3. **isInAlphabet Method** (`Base32:isInAlphabet(B)Z`): This method is called to check if the padding byte is valid. If the padding byte is indeed in the alphabet, it will return true, causing the exception to be thrown.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 0 corresponds to the constructor that initializes the `Base32` object.\n- Method ID 1 corresponds to the constructor that contains the logic for validating the padding byte.\n- Method ID 3 corresponds to the method that checks if the padding byte is in the alphabet. \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure."
