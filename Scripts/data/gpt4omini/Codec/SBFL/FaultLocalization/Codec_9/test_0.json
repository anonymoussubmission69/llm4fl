    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and the stack trace, the test `testCodec112` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` that indicates the input array is too big for the specified maximum size. The stack trace points to the `encodeBase64` method in the `Base64` class, which is likely being called with parameters that lead to this exception.\n\nNow, let's analyze the methods provided:\n\n1. **Method 0: `encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData)`**\n   - This method calls another `encodeBase64` method with a single parameter and a default value for the second parameter. It does not handle any size constraints or exceptions, which makes it less suspicious on its own.\n\n2. **Method 1: `encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked)`**\n   - Similar to Method 0, this method calls another `encodeBase64` method with two parameters. It also does not handle size constraints or exceptions, making it less suspicious.\n\n3. **Method 2: `getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)`**\n   - This method calculates the length of the encoded data based on the input array and chunk size. It does not directly throw exceptions but is responsible for determining the length that could lead to an exception if the calculated length exceeds the maximum size. This method is somewhat suspicious as it plays a role in determining the output size.\n\n4. **Method 4: `encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)`**\n   - This method is the most suspicious because it directly checks if the length of the encoded data exceeds the `maxResultSize`. If it does, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. This method is directly related to the exception thrown in the test, making it the most likely source of the issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method checks if the encoded length exceeds the maximum result size and throws an IllegalArgumentException if it does.
