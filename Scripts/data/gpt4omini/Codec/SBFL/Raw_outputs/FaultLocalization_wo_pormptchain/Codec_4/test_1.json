"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'encode' method is directly involved in the encoding process that the test is validating. Since the test fails when comparing the encoded output, this method is highly suspicious as it is responsible for the core functionality being tested.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'encode' method with parameters is crucial for processing the input byte array. Any issues in this method could lead to incorrect encoding results, making it a strong candidate for the fault.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getEncodeLength' method calculates the length of the encoded output. If this method returns an incorrect length, it could lead to buffer overflows or underflows, causing the encoding to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'isUrlSafe' method determines if the encoding is URL safe. While it may not directly cause the failure, if the test expects a specific encoding type, this method could influence the behavior of the encoding process.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
