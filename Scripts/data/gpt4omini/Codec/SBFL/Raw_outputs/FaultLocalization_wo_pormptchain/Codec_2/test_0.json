"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'read(byte b[], int offset, int len)' is responsible for reading bytes into the provided array.

If the 'read()' method is not correctly processing the return value from 'read(byte[], int, int)', it could lead to incorrect EOF handling, contributing to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'hasData()' checks if there is data available to read. If this method incorrectly returns false when there is data, it could lead to premature EOF conditions, causing the test to fail.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of 'Base64InputStream' initializes the stream and the Base64 encoder.
