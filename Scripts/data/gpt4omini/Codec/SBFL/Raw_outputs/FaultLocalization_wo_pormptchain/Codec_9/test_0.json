"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)' is directly responsible for throwing the IllegalArgumentException when the input array size exceeds the specified maximum size. The test case indicates that the output array would be larger than the maximum size, which suggests a fault in this method's handling of input sizes.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe)' calls the more specific method that throws the exception. If the parameters passed to this method do not correctly account for the maximum size, it could lead to the exception being thrown. Thus, it is suspicious as it is part of the call chain.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked)' is also part of the call chain leading to the exception. It is responsible for preparing the data for encoding, and if it does not handle the input size correctly, it could contribute to the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData)' is the entry point for encoding without chunking.
