"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method decodeQuotedPrintable(byte[] bytes) is responsible for decoding quoted-printable encoded data.

This suggests that the method may not be handling certain input cases correctly, leading to the DecoderException.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method Utils.digit16(byte b) is called within decodeQuotedPrintable to convert a byte to a hexadecimal digit.
