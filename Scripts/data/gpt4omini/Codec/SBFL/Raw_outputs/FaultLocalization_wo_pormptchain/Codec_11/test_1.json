"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method Utils.digit16(byte b) is responsible for converting a byte to a hexadecimal digit. The stack trace indicates that an invalid digit was encountered, which suggests that this method may not be handling certain input values correctly, leading to the DecoderException.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method QuotedPrintableCodec.decodeQuotedPrintable(byte[] bytes) calls Utils.digit16() and processes the byte array. If the input bytes contain invalid hexadecimal sequences, it will trigger the exception seen in the stack trace. This method is directly involved in the decoding process and is likely where the fault originates.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method QuotedPrintableCodec.decode(String pString, String charset) is responsible for decoding a string using the specified charset. It calls decodeQuotedPrintable() and could be indirectly responsible for the error if it passes invalid data to it.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method QuotedPrintableCodec.decode(String pString) is a higher-level method that calls the more specific decode() method.
