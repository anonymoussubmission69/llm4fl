"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'map' is responsible for mapping characters to their corresponding Soundex values. The stack trace indicates that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown when a character is not mapped, specifically mentioning 'The character is not mapped: \u0130'. This suggests that the method is not handling certain characters correctly, making it highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'soundex' method calls 'clean' and 'getMappingCode', and it processes the input string. If the input string contains characters that are not mapped, it could lead to issues. Since the test fails when encoding a string with '\u0130', this method is also suspicious as it directly interacts with the mapping process.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'getMappingCode' method retrieves the mapping for a character. If it receives an unmapped character, it could lead to unexpected behavior. Given that the test fails due to an unmapped character, this method is also suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'clean' method is responsible for cleaning the input string before it is processed.
