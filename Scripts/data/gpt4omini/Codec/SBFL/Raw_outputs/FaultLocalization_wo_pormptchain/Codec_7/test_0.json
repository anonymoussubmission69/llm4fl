"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeToString' is directly involved in the test that failed. The test expected a specific Base64 encoded string but received a different result, indicating a potential issue in how the encoding is handled.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64String' is also involved in the test. It calls 'encodeBase64' and then 'newStringUtf8', which could potentially introduce errors in the encoding process.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'newStringUtf8' is responsible for converting the byte array to a UTF-8 string. If there is an issue with the byte array being passed to it, it could lead to incorrect string representation.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64' is responsible for the actual encoding of the byte array. If there is a bug in this method, it could lead to incorrect Base64 encoding.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
