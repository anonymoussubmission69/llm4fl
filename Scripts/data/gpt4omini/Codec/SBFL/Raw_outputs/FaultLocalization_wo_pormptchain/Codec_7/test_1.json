"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64String' is directly involved in encoding the byte array to a Base64 string. The test failure indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output, suggesting that this method may not be handling the input correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getBytesUtf8' converts a string to a byte array using UTF-8 encoding. If there is an issue with how the string is being converted to bytes, it could lead to incorrect Base64 encoding results.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'newStringUtf8' is responsible for creating a new string from a byte array. If this method does not handle the byte array correctly, it could affect the output of the Base64 encoding.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64' is responsible for encoding the byte array into Base64 format.
