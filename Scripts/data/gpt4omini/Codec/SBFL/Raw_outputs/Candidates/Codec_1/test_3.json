"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testLocaleIndependence` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` when comparing the encoded strings for different locales. The test is designed to check if the `StringEncoder` behaves consistently across different locales.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `RefinedSoundex` class and the `SoundexUtils` class. The following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`encode(String pString)`** - This method is responsible for encoding the input string. If there is an issue with how it encodes strings based on locale, it could lead to the test failure.\n   \n2. **`getMappingCode(char c)`** - This method maps characters to their corresponding soundex codes. If the mapping is incorrect or not locale-sensitive, it could affect the encoding results.\n\n3. **`soundex(String str)`** - This method performs the main soundex encoding logic. Any issues in this method could directly impact the output of the `encode` method.\n\n4. **`clean(String str)`** - This method cleans the input string before encoding. If it does not handle locale-specific characters correctly, it could lead to unexpected results.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the test failure."
