"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCodec101` is failing because the second read from the `Base64InputStream` is expected to return an end-of-stream signal (c < 0), but it seems to be returning 0 instead. This indicates that the stream is not behaving as expected after the first read.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **Base64InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)** - This method is directly responsible for reading from the input stream and is where the failure occurs. The logic for handling the end-of-stream condition should be closely examined.\n2. **Base64.hasData()** - This method checks if there is data available in the buffer. If it returns false when it shouldn't, it could lead to the read method returning 0.\n3. **Base64InputStream.<init>(InputStream)** - The constructor initializes the stream. If there are issues with how the stream is set up, it could affect subsequent reads.\n4. **Base64InputStream.<init>(InputStream, boolean)** - Similar to the previous constructor, this one also initializes the stream with an additional parameter. The handling of the `doEncode` flag could affect the behavior of the stream.\n5. **Base64.decode(byte[], int, int)** - This method is involved in decoding the data. If there are issues in the decoding logic, it could affect the data being read.\n6. **Base64.readResults(byte[], int, int)** - This method processes the results of the read operation. If it does not handle the buffer correctly, it could lead to unexpected results.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
