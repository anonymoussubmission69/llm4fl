"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testCodec112` is designed to test the Base64 encoding functionality. It attempts to encode a byte array of size 0, which is expected to be handled by the `Base64.encodeBase64` method.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to the input array being too large for the specified maximum size. This suggests that the issue lies in the handling of input sizes within the Base64 encoding methods.\n3. The methods that are directly involved in the encoding process and could potentially lead to this exception include:\n   - `encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData)`\n   - `encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked)`\n   - `encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)`\n   - `getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)`\n\nThese methods are responsible for encoding the byte array and determining the output size, which is where the exception is being triggered.\n\n### Suspicious Methods:\n1. `encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData)` - Method ID: 0\n2. `encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked)` - Method ID: 1\n3. `encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)` - Method ID: 4\n4. `getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)` - Method ID: 2\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe methods listed above are suspicious as they are directly related to the encoding process and the exception thrown indicates a problem with input size handling. Further analysis of these methods is required to identify the root cause of the failure.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4]\n}\n```"
