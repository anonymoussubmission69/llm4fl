"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testTrailingSpecial` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected output with the actual output of the `qpcodec.encode(plain)` method. The expected output contains a specific encoded representation of special characters, while the actual output does not match this expectation.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potential candidates for further investigation:\n\n1. **`QuotedPrintableCodec:encode(String pString)`** - This method is responsible for encoding a string into quoted-printable format. Since the test is directly calling this method, any issues in the encoding logic could lead to the observed failure.\n\n2. **`QuotedPrintableCodec:encodeQuotedPrintable(BitSet printable, byte[] bytes)`** - This method handles the actual encoding of bytes into quoted-printable format. If there are issues with how printable characters are determined or how bytes are processed, it could affect the output.\n\n3. **`QuotedPrintableCodec:encodeQuotedPrintable(int b, ByteArrayOutputStream buffer)`** - This method encodes a single byte into its quoted-printable representation. Any bugs in this method could lead to incorrect encoding of special characters.\n\n4. **`QuotedPrintableCodec:getDefaultCharset()`** - This method returns the default character set used for encoding. If the charset is not set correctly, it could lead to unexpected results in the encoding process.\n\n5. **`QuotedPrintableCodec:encode(String pString, String charset)`** - This method encodes a string using a specified charset. If the charset is not handled properly, it could lead to discrepancies in the output.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 5, 6, 7, 9]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
