"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output when encoding a string using the `QuotedPrintableCodec`. The specific issue seems to be related to how whitespace and soft breaks are handled in the encoding process.\n\n2. The most suspicious method is `encodeQuotedPrintable` (method_id: 7) because it directly handles the encoding logic and is likely where the encoding discrepancies arise.\n\n3. The second suspicious method is `encode` (method_id: 6) that takes a string and a charset. If the charset is not handled correctly, it could lead to encoding issues.\n\n4. The method `encode(String pString)` (method_id: 5) is less suspicious because it calls another encoding method with a default charset if the input string is null, which is a safer approach.\n\n5. The method `getDefaultCharset` (method_id: 0) is the least suspicious as it simply returns the default charset without any processing.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **Method ID 7 (encodeQuotedPrintable)**: Review the logic for handling printable characters and ensure that whitespace and soft breaks are encoded correctly. Specifically, check how the method handles the encoding of bytes that are not printable and ensure that it correctly encodes soft breaks as per the quoted-printable specification.\n\n- **Method ID 6 (encode)**: Ensure that the charset provided is valid and handle cases where the charset might not be supported. Consider adding a fallback mechanism or throwing a more descriptive exception.\n\n- **Method ID 5 (encode)**: This method is relatively safe, but ensure that the default charset is correctly set and that it does not lead to unexpected behavior when encoding null strings.\n\n- **Method ID 0 (getDefaultCharset)**: No changes needed as this method is straightforward.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\n1. Method ID 7 (encodeQuotedPrintable) - Rank 1\n2. Method ID 6 (encode) - Rank 2\n3. Method ID 5 (encode) - Rank 3\n4. Method ID 0 (getDefaultCharset) - Rank 4\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
