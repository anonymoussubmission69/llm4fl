"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method 4** (`encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)`):\n   - This method checks if the encoded length exceeds the maximum result size and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it does. The test indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when the input array is too big, which directly relates to this method. \n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the `maxResultSize` is correctly set based on the expected output size. If the input data is small, consider adjusting the `maxResultSize` accordingly.\n\n2. **Method 2** (`getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)`):\n   - This method calculates the length of the encoded data. If the calculated length exceeds the maximum size, it could lead to an exception. The method does not seem to have a direct check for maximum size constraints.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add a check to ensure that the calculated length does not exceed the maximum size before returning it.\n\n3. **Method 1** (`encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked)`):\n   - This method calls another `encodeBase64` method with two parameters but does not handle size constraints or exceptions. It relies on the other method to handle these checks.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Consider adding a wrapper that checks the size constraints before calling the more complex `encodeBase64` method.\n\n4. **Method 0** (`encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData)`):\n   - This method calls another `encodeBase64` method with a single parameter and a default value for the second parameter. It does not handle any size constraints or exceptions.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Similar to Method 1, add a size check before calling the overloaded method.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods\nAfter analyzing the methods and their potential fixes, the re-ranking of suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThis ranking remains the same as the original since Method 4 is still the most suspicious due to its direct relation to the exception thrown in the test."
