"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testCodec112` is attempting to encode a byte array using the `Base64.encodeBase64` method. The stack trace indicates that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown due to the input array being too large for the specified maximum size.\n2. The exception occurs in the `Base64.encodeBase64` method, specifically at line 829 in the `Base64` class.\n3. The test also calls `Base64.encodeBase64(in, false, false, out.length)`, which suggests that the method is being tested with specific parameters that may lead to the exception.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`Base64.encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)`** (method_id: 10): This method is directly responsible for handling the encoding and is where the exception is thrown.\n- **`Base64.getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)`** (method_id: 13): This method calculates the length of the encoded output, which is crucial for understanding why the exception is thrown.\n- **`Base64.encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData)`** (method_id: 8): This method is a wrapper that calls the overloaded method and may also be relevant to the test.\n- **`Base64.encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked)`** (method_id: 9): This method is another overload that could be involved in the encoding process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 13, 8, 9]\n}\n```"
