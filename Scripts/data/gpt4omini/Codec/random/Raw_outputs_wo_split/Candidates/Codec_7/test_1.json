"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testRfc4648Section10Encode` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output. The test is checking the output of the `Base64.encodeBase64String` method, which is likely responsible for the encoding process.\n\nThe stack trace points to the following methods that are involved in the encoding process:\n\n1. **`Base64.encodeBase64String(byte[] binaryData)`** - This method is directly called in the test and is responsible for converting the byte array to a Base64 encoded string.\n2. **`Base64.encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked)`** - This method is called within `encodeBase64String` and handles the actual encoding logic.\n3. **`Base64.encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe)`** - This method is called within the previous method and may also influence the encoding behavior.\n4. **`Base64.encode(byte[] pArray)`** - This method is responsible for the actual byte array encoding.\n5. **`Base64.getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)`** - This method calculates the length of the encoded output, which could affect the final result.\n\nAdditionally, the `StringUtils.getBytesUtf8(String string)` method is involved in converting the input string to a byte array, which is also crucial for the encoding process.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be examined further:\n\n- `Base64.encodeBase64String(byte[])`\n- `Base64.encodeBase64(byte[], boolean)`\n- `Base64.encodeBase64(byte[], boolean, boolean)`\n- `Base64.encode(byte[])`\n- `Base64.getEncodeLength(byte[], int, byte[])`\n- `StringUtils.getBytesUtf8(String)`\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 0]\n}\n```"
