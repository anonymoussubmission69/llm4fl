"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCodec200` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` that indicates the padding byte must not be in the alphabet or whitespace. This exception is thrown in the constructor of the `Base32` class when the padding byte is checked against the alphabet.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure originates from the `Base32` constructor, which calls the `BaseNCodec` constructor. The relevant methods that need to be analyzed for potential faults are:\n\n1. **BaseNCodec Constructor**: This method initializes the codec and is indirectly involved in the failure.\n2. **Base32 Constructor (boolean, byte)**: This constructor is directly called in the test and leads to the failure.\n3. **Base32 Constructor (int, byte[], boolean, byte)**: This constructor contains the logic that checks if the padding byte is valid and throws the exception.\n4. **isInAlphabet Method**: This method is used to check if the padding byte is valid and is crucial in determining the cause of the exception.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 0**: `BaseNCodec` constructor - involved in the initialization process.\n- **Method ID 1**: `Base32` constructor (boolean, byte) - directly called in the test.\n- **Method ID 2**: `Base32` constructor (int, byte[], boolean, byte) - contains the logic that leads to the exception.\n- **Method ID 4**: `isInAlphabet` method - checks the validity of the padding byte."
