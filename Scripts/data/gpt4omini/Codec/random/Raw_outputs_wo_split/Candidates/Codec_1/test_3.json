"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test failure is related to the `testLocaleIndependence` method in the `StringEncoderAbstractTest` class. The stack trace indicates that an assertion failed, which suggests that the output of a method being tested did not match the expected result.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `SoundexUtils` and `RefinedSoundex` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n1. **`SoundexUtils.clean(String str)`**: This method is responsible for cleaning the input string. If it does not handle null or empty strings correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior in subsequent methods.\n\n2. **`RefinedSoundex.soundex(String str)`**: This method relies on the output of `SoundexUtils.clean(str)`. If `clean` does not return a valid string, it could cause issues in the soundex encoding process.\n\n3. **`RefinedSoundex.getMappingCode(char c)`**: This method is called within the `soundex` method. If the input character is not valid, it could lead to incorrect mapping and thus affect the final output.\n\n4. **`RefinedSoundex.encode(String pString)`**: This method is a higher-level method that calls `soundex`. If `soundex` fails due to issues in `clean` or `getMappingCode`, it will propagate the error.\n\nGiven the interdependencies of these methods, they all need to be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
