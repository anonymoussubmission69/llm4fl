"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSkipNotEncodedCRLF` is designed to test the decoding of a quoted-printable encoded string. The test fails with a `DecoderException` indicating an invalid URL encoding due to a non-valid digit in radix 16.\n\n2. The stack trace points to several methods involved in the decoding process, particularly:\n   - `Utils.digit16(byte b)` which is responsible for converting a byte to a hexadecimal digit.\n   - `QuotedPrintableCodec.decodeQuotedPrintable(byte[] bytes)` which handles the quoted-printable decoding.\n   - The `decode` methods in `QuotedPrintableCodec` that are called during the decoding process.\n\n3. The methods that are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious include:\n   - `Utils.digit16(byte b)` (method_id: 3): This method throws a `DecoderException` if the byte does not represent a valid hexadecimal digit.\n   - `QuotedPrintableCodec.decodeQuotedPrintable(byte[] bytes)` (method_id: 7): This method is responsible for the main decoding logic and calls `Utils.digit16`.\n   - `QuotedPrintableCodec.decode(String pString)` (method_id: 10): This method is the entry point for decoding a string and may indirectly lead to the failure.\n\nGiven this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [3, 7, 10]\n}\n```"
