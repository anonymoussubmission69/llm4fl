"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testCodec98NPE` is designed to test the `Base64OutputStream` class, specifically its ability to handle a certain input without throwing a `NullPointerException`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `NullPointerException` occurred in the `Base64.decode` method, which is called during the `close` method of `Base64OutputStream`.\n3. The `Base64OutputStream.close()` method calls `base64.decode(singleByte, 0, -1)`, which suggests that the issue may arise from the parameters being passed to the `decode` method, particularly the `-1` for the length.\n4. The `Base64.decode` method is likely not handling the case where the length is negative, leading to the `NullPointerException`.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `Base64.decode(byte[] in, int inPos, int inAvail)` (method_id: 6): This method is directly involved in the decoding process and is where the exception is thrown.\n- `Base64OutputStream.close()` (method_id: 14): This method is where the call to `Base64.decode` is made, and it is crucial to understand how it handles its parameters.\n- `Base64OutputStream.write(byte[] b, int offset, int len)` (method_id: 12): This method is responsible for writing data to the stream and may influence the state of the `Base64` object, potentially affecting the `close` method.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [6, 12, 14]\n}\n```"
