"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBase64EmptyInputStream` is failing due to an assertion error indicating that the expected value was -1, but the actual value was 13. This suggests that there is an issue with how the `Base64InputStream` is handling an empty input stream.\n\nThe methods covered by the failed test include:\n\n1. **Base64InputStream constructor** - Initializes the stream.\n2. **read()** - Reads a single byte from the stream.\n3. **read(byte[], int, int)** - Reads bytes into an array.\n4. **Base64 constructor** - Initializes the Base64 encoder/decoder.\n5. **hasData()** - Checks if there is data available.\n6. **avail()** - Returns the number of bytes available.\n7. **readResults(byte[], int, int)** - Reads results into a byte array.\n8. **encode(byte[], int, int)** - Encodes bytes.\n9. **containsBase64Byte(byte[])** - Checks if the array contains Base64 bytes.\n\nGiven the nature of the failure, the following methods are particularly suspicious:\n\n- **read()**: This method is directly involved in reading from the stream and could be responsible for returning an incorrect value.\n- **read(byte[], int, int)**: This method handles reading multiple bytes and could also be a source of the issue if it does not handle the empty input correctly.\n- **hasData()**: This method checks if there is data to read, which is crucial for handling an empty input stream.\n- **avail()**: This method returns the number of available bytes, which could be related to the incorrect value being returned.\n- **readResults(byte[], int, int)**: This method processes the results of the read operation and could be involved in the incorrect handling of the empty input.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 6, 7]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
