The test `testCodec105` is attempting to read from a `Base64InputStream`, which is initialized with a `Codec105ErrorInputStream`. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred during the execution of the `Base64.encode` method, which is called from the `Base64InputStream.read` method.\n\n2. The methods involved in the stack trace are:\n   - `Base64.encode` (method_id: 11)\n   - `Base64InputStream.read` (method_id: 1)\n   - `Base64InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)` (method_id: 2)\n\n3. The `Base64InputStream` constructor (method_id: 0) is also relevant as it initializes the stream and sets up the encoding process.\n\n4. The `Base64` class has several methods that could potentially lead to the fault, particularly those that handle buffer management and encoding logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are suspicious and should be further investigated:\n\n- `Base64InputStream.<init>` (method_id: 0)\n- `Base64InputStream.read` (method_id: 1)\n- `Base64InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)` (method_id: 2)\n- `Base64.encode` (method_id: 11)\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the failure and could be propagating the fault.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 11]\n}\n```"
