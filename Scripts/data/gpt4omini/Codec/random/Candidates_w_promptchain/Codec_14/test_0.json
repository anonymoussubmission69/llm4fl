The test `testCompatibilityWithOriginalVersion` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError` indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output from the `encode` method.\n2. The `encode` method is called multiple times with different parameters, and it is likely that the issue lies within the logic of this method or the methods it calls.\n3. The stack trace points to the `PhoneticEngineRegressionTest` class, specifically at line 190, which corresponds to the `encode` method being invoked.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several methods from the `PhoneticEngine`, `Rule`, and `Lang` classes, among others. The methods that are most likely to be suspicious and need further analysis are:\n\n- `PhoneticEngine:encode(Ljava/lang/String;Lorg/apache/commons/codec/language/bm/Languages$LanguageSet;)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 10)\n- `Rule:getInstanceMap(Lorg/apache/commons/codec/language/bm/NameType;Lorg/apache/commons/codec/language/bm/RuleType;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/Map;` (method_id: 35)\n- `PhoneticEngine:applyFinalRules(Lorg/apache/commons/codec/language/bm/PhoneticEngine$PhonemeBuilder;Ljava/util/Map;)Lorg/apache/commons/codec/language/bm/PhoneticEngine$PhonemeBuilder;` (method_id: 8)\n- `PhoneticEngine$RulesApplication:invoke()Lorg/apache/commons/codec/language/bm/PhoneticEngine$RulesApplication;` (method_id: 74)\n\nThese methods are critical in the encoding process and may contain the logic that leads to the discrepancy observed in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 35, 8, 74]\n}\n```"
