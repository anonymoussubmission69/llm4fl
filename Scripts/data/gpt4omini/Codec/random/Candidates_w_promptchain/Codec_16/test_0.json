    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCodec200` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` that indicates the padding byte must not be in the alphabet or whitespace. This exception is thrown in the constructor of the `Base32` class when the padding byte is checked against the alphabet.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure originates from the `Base32` constructor, which calls the `BaseNCodec` constructor. The relevant methods that need to be analyzed for potential faults are:\n\n1. **BaseNCodec Constructor**: This method initializes the codec and is indirectly related to the failure since it is called by the `Base32` constructor.\n2. **Base32 Constructor (boolean, byte)**: This constructor is directly involved in the test and is where the exception is thrown.\n3. **Base32 Constructor (int, byte[], boolean, byte)**: This constructor is also called by the previous constructor and contains the logic that checks the padding byte.\n4. **isInAlphabet Method**: This method is used to check if the padding byte is valid, and it is crucial to understand how it determines if a byte is in the alphabet.\n\nBased on this analysis, the suspicious methods that need further investigation are:\n\n- `BaseNCodec:<init>(IIIIB)V` (method_id: 0)\n- `Base32:<init>(ZB)V` (method_id: 1)\n- `Base32:<init>(I[BZB)V` (method_id: 2)\n- `Base32:isInAlphabet(B)Z` (method_id: 4)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 4]\n}\n```"
