"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method 10** (`encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe)`):\n   - This method calls another `encodeBase64` method with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as the maximum size. This can lead to an `IllegalArgumentException` if the input data is large, as indicated by the stack trace.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Change the maximum size from `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to a more reasonable limit based on the expected input size or handle the exception properly.\n\n2. **Method 9** (`encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked)`):\n   - This method is a wrapper that calls the overloaded `encodeBase64` method with `urlSafe` set to false. While it does not directly cause the issue, it contributes to the chain of calls leading to the problem.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the input data is validated before calling the method to prevent passing large arrays.\n\n3. **Method 13** (`getEncodeLength(byte[] pArray, int chunkSize, byte[] chunkSeparator)`):\n   - This method calculates the length of the encoded data. If the calculated length exceeds the maximum size, it could lead to issues, but it does not directly handle encoding.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Add checks to ensure that the calculated length does not exceed the maximum allowable size before proceeding with encoding.\n\n4. **Method 8** (`encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData)`):\n   - This method is a wrapper that calls the overloaded `encodeBase64` method with `isChunked` set to false. It does not directly contribute to the issue.\n   - **Potential Fix**: Similar to Method 9, ensure input validation before calling the method.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods\nGiven the analysis, the re-ranking of the methods based on their suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n1. **Method 10**: Most suspicious due to direct cause of the exception.\n2. **Method 9**: Second most suspicious as it indirectly contributes to the issue.\n3. **Method 13**: Third, as it calculates length but does not directly cause the exception.\n4. **Method 8**: Least suspicious, as it does not contribute to the issue.\n\n### Final Output\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
