"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test is failing due to an assertion error where the expected output does not match the actual output. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the encoding logic, particularly in how non-printable characters and whitespace are handled.\n\n2. The most suspicious method is `encodeQuotedPrintable` (method ID 6) because it contains the core logic for encoding bytes into quoted-printable format. Any issues in how bytes are processed or how non-printable characters are handled could lead to incorrect output.\n\n3. The `encode` method (method ID 7) is also suspicious as it directly calls `encodeQuotedPrintable`, and any issues in the input bytes or how printable characters are defined could lead to encoding errors.\n\n4. The `encode` method for strings (method ID 8) is less suspicious but still relevant since it checks for null input and handles encoding logic. If the default charset or subsequent encoding logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\n5. The constructors (method IDs 0 and 1) are the least suspicious as they primarily set up the codec and do not directly influence the encoding logic.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **Method ID 6 (encodeQuotedPrintable)**: Ensure that the logic for handling non-printable characters is correct. Specifically, check how bytes are processed and ensure that the encoding for non-printable characters is correctly implemented. Add logging to trace the values being processed.\n\n- **Method ID 7 (encode)**: Validate the input bytes before passing them to `encodeQuotedPrintable`. Ensure that the `PRINTABLE_CHARS` BitSet is correctly defined and includes all necessary characters.\n\n- **Method ID 8 (encode)**: Ensure that the default charset is correctly set and that the encoding logic handles all edge cases, including whitespace and non-printable characters.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\n1. Method ID 6 (encodeQuotedPrintable) - Most suspicious\n2. Method ID 7 (encode) - Second most suspicious\n3. Method ID 8 (encode) - Third most suspicious\n4. Method ID 0 (QuotedPrintableCodec constructor) - Less suspicious\n5. Method ID 1 (QuotedPrintableCodec constructor with charset) - Least suspicious\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 7,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 8,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n```"
