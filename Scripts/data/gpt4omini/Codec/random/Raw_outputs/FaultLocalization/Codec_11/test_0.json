"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the issue seems to stem from the `decode` method in the `QuotedPrintableCodec` class, which is throwing a `DecoderException` due to an invalid URL encoding. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs when trying to decode a quoted-printable encoded string, specifically when the `digit16` method is called.\n\nHere's the analysis of the methods:\n\n1. **Method ID 3: `digit16(byte b)`**\n   - This method converts a byte to a hexadecimal digit. If the byte does not represent a valid hexadecimal digit, it throws a `DecoderException`. Given that the stack trace indicates an invalid digit error, this method is highly suspicious as it directly relates to the error being thrown.\n\n2. **Method ID 7: `decodeQuotedPrintable(byte[] bytes)`**\n   - This method processes the byte array and calls `digit16` to decode bytes that are escaped. If the input bytes contain invalid hexadecimal characters, it will lead to the exception being thrown. This method is also very suspicious as it is the one that directly handles the decoding logic.\n\n3. **Method ID 8: `decode(byte[] bytes)`**\n   - This method simply calls `decodeQuotedPrintable`. While it is part of the decoding process, it does not contain any logic that could directly cause the exception. It is less suspicious than the previous two methods.\n\n4. **Method ID 10: `decode(String pString)`**\n   - This method is responsible for decoding a string but does not directly handle the byte array decoding. It calls another decode method with a default charset if the input string is null. This method is the least suspicious as it does not directly relate to the error in the stack trace.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The digit16 method converts a byte to a hexadecimal digit and throws a DecoderException if the byte is not a valid digit.
