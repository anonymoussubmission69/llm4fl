"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeToString' is responsible for converting a byte array to a String using UTF-8 encoding. The test failure indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output of this method, suggesting that it may not be handling the input correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 19,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64' is responsible for encoding a byte array into Base64 format. Since the test is related to Base64 encoding, any issues in this method could directly affect the output of 'encodeToString'.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64String' calls 'encodeBase64' and then converts the result to a String. If there is an issue in the encoding process, it will propagate to this method, making it suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getBytesUtf8' is responsible for converting a String to a byte array using UTF-8 encoding.
