"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encode(String pString, String charset)' is responsible for encoding a string using a specified charset.
