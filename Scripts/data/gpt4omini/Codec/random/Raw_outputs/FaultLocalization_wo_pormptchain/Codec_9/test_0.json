"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 11,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'encodeBase64(byte[] binaryData, boolean isChunked, boolean urlSafe, int maxResultSize)' is directly responsible for throwing the IllegalArgumentException when the input array size exceeds the specified maximum size.
