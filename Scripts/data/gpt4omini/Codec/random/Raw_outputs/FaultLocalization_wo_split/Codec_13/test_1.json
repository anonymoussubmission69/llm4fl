"Based on the provided test and stack trace, the test `testCodec184` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` in the `isDoubleMetaphoneEqual` method. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurs at line 244 of the `DoubleMetaphone` class, which corresponds to the `isDoubleMetaphoneEqual` method.\n\n### Analysis of Methods:\n\n1. **Method 3: `isDoubleMetaphoneEqual`**\n   - **Body**: \n     ```java\n     public boolean isDoubleMetaphoneEqual(final String value1, final String value2, final boolean alternate) {\n         return doubleMetaphone(value1, alternate).equals(doubleMetaphone(value2, alternate));\n     }\n     ```\n   - **Reasoning**: This method calls `doubleMetaphone` on both `value1` and `value2`. If either of these values is `null`, the method will throw a `NullPointerException` when trying to call `.equals()` on the result of `doubleMetaphone`. This method is highly suspicious as it directly leads to the exception observed in the test.\n\n2. **Method 2: `doubleMetaphone`**\n   - **Body**: \n     ```java\n     public String doubleMetaphone(String value, final boolean alternate) {\n         value = cleanInput(value);\n         if (value == null) {\n             return null;\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n   - **Reasoning**: This method calls `cleanInput` and checks if the result is `null`. If `cleanInput` returns `null`, it will not throw an exception, but it will return `null`. However, if `cleanInput` does not handle the input correctly, it could lead to `isDoubleMetaphoneEqual` receiving `null` values. This method is suspicious but less so than `isDoubleMetaphoneEqual`.\n\n3. **Method 4: `cleanInput`**\n   - **Body**: \n     ```java\n     private String cleanInput(String input) {\n         if (input == null) {\n             input = input.trim();\n             if (input.length() == 0) {\n                 return null;\n             }\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n   - **Reasoning**: This method has a logical flaw. The check for `input == null` should be the first condition, but it attempts to call `input.trim()` on a `null` input, which will throw a `NullPointerException`. This method is the least suspicious in terms of direct impact on the test failure, but it contains a critical bug that could lead to the observed issue.\n\n### Ranking of Methods:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method directly leads to a NullPointerException when either value1 or value2 is null, as it attempts to call .equals() on the result of doubleMetaphone, which can be null.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method processes the input and can return null if cleanInput returns null.
