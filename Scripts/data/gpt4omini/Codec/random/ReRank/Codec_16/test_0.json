    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here are the findings:\n\n1. **Method ID 2 (Base32 Constructor)**: This method directly checks if the padding character is in the alphabet or is whitespace. If it is, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. This is the direct cause of the test failure, making it the most suspicious method.\n\n2. **Method ID 4 (isInAlphabet)**: This method checks if the padding character is within the valid range of the decode table. While it does not throw an exception itself, it is called by the constructor that does throw the exception. Therefore, it is still suspicious but less so than the constructor.\n\n3. **Method ID 1 (Base32 Constructor Delegation)**: This method simply delegates to another constructor and does not contain any logic that could lead to the exception. Thus, it is the least suspicious.\n\n### Suggested Fixes:\n- **For Method ID 2**: Ensure that the padding character is validated correctly. If the padding character is valid, it should proceed without throwing an exception. If it is invalid, the exception should be thrown as is. However, consider adding more descriptive error messages to help identify the issue more clearly.\n\n- **For Method ID 4**: This method seems to be functioning correctly, but ensure that the `decodeTable` is properly initialized and contains the expected values. If the `decodeTable` is not set up correctly, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n- **For Method ID 1**: No changes are necessary as it is simply delegating to the other constructor.\n\n### Re-Ranked Methods:\n1. Method ID 2 - Rank 1 (most suspicious)\n2. Method ID 4 - Rank 2 (suspicious)\n3. Method ID 1 - Rank 3 (least suspicious)\n\nHere is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
