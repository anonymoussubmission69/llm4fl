    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCodec200` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` that indicates the `pad` byte must not be in the alphabet or whitespace. This exception is thrown in the constructor of the `Base32` class when the `pad` value is checked against the alphabet.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs in the following methods:\n1. `Base32.<init>(Base32.java:309)` - This is the constructor of the `Base32` class where the exception is thrown.\n2. `Base32.<init>(Base32.java:193)` - This is another constructor of the `Base32` class that calls the first constructor.\n3. `Base32Test.testCodec200(Base32Test.java:158)` - This is the test method that is invoking the `Base32` constructor.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include:\n- `BaseNCodec.<init>(IIIIB)V` - This is a parent class constructor that initializes some parameters but is not directly related to the exception.\n- `Base32.<init>(ZB)V` - This constructor initializes the `Base32` object with a boolean and a pad byte.\n- `Base32.<init>(I[BZB)V` - This constructor is where the exception is thrown due to the pad byte being invalid.\n- `Base32:isInAlphabet(B)Z` - This method checks if the pad byte is in the alphabet, which is directly related to the exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n1. `Base32.<init>(I[BZB)V` - This method is where the exception is thrown.\n2. `Base32:isInAlphabet(B)Z` - This method is responsible for checking the validity of the pad byte.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 2, 4]\n}\n``` \n\n- Method ID 1 corresponds to `Base32.<init>(ZB)V`, which is relevant as it initializes the `Base32` object.\n- Method ID 2 corresponds to `Base32.<init>(I[BZB)V`, which is where the exception is thrown.\n- Method ID 4 corresponds to `Base32:isInAlphabet(B)Z`, which checks if the pad byte is valid."
