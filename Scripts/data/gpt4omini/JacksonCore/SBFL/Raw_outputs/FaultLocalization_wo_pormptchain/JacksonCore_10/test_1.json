"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 9,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The addName method is responsible for adding names to the symbol table and involves complex logic for handling collisions and rehashing. The failure in the test indicates that the primary count of symbols is not matching the expected value, which suggests that there might be an issue in how names are being added or counted.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The _verifyNeedForRehash method checks if the current count of symbols exceeds half of the hash size, which could trigger a rehash. If the rehashing logic is faulty, it could lead to incorrect counts being reported, contributing to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The primaryCount method calculates the number of primary entries in the hash table. If this method is not correctly counting the entries, it would directly affect the test's assertion about the primary count.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The bucketCount method simply returns the hash size. While it seems straightforward, if the hash size is not being managed correctly during insertions or rehashing, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected counts.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
