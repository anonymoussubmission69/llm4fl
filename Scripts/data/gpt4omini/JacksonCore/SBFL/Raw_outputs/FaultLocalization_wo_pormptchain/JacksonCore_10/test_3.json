"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'bucketCount()' returns the size of the hash table. The test expected a bucket count of 1024 but received 2048, indicating a potential issue with how the bucket count is calculated or updated.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'rehash()' method is responsible for resizing the hash table. If this method is not functioning correctly, it could lead to an incorrect bucket count, which is directly related to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'nukeSymbols(boolean fill)' method resets the symbol count and spillover end. If this method is called incorrectly or not at the right time, it could affect the overall count and lead to discrepancies in the bucket count.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'size()' method returns the current count of symbols. If this method is not accurately reflecting the number of symbols, it could contribute to the incorrect bucket count.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
