"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'bucketCount()' returns the size of the hash table, which is expected to be 16384. However, the test fails with an actual value of 32768. This discrepancy indicates that the method may not be correctly calculating or maintaining the bucket count, making it highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'rehash()' method is responsible for resizing the hash table and could potentially lead to incorrect bucket counts if not implemented correctly. If the rehashing logic is flawed, it could result in the observed failure in the test.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method '_reportTooManyCollisions()' checks for the number of collisions and may influence the rehashing process.
