"Based on the provided test body and stack trace, as well as the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _outputRawMultiByteChar is responsible for handling multi-byte characters, including surrogate pairs. The error message indicates a split surrogate issue, which suggests that this method may not be correctly handling the input when it encounters a surrogate character.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 72,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method writeRaw is responsible for writing raw character data. It calls _outputRawMultiByteChar, which is where the error occurs. If writeRaw does not properly handle the character data, it could lead to the split surrogate error.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 73,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method writeRaw(char[] cbuf, int offset, int len) is responsible for writing raw character data from a character array. If the character array contains surrogate pairs, this method could also contribute to the split surrogate issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 75,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _verifyValueWrite checks the context for writing values. If the context is not correctly set up for writing surrogate pairs, it could lead to issues when writing raw values, although it is less directly related to the split surrogate error.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
