"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods by the failed test, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 58,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _parseNumber is responsible for parsing numbers from the input stream.

This suggests that the logic for handling number parsing may be flawed, making it the most suspicious method.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The resetInt method is called within _parseNumber to reset the state for parsing integers.

It is closely related to the number parsing process.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 70,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The nextToken method is responsible for advancing the parser to the next token.
