"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testSyntheticWithBytesNew` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected primary count is 8534, but the actual count is 8524. This indicates that there is a discrepancy in the counting mechanism, likely related to how names are added or how the hash table is managed.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 10,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _verifyNeedForRehash checks if the current count exceeds half of the hash size and sets the need for rehashing. If rehashing is not triggered correctly, it could lead to incorrect counts in the hash table, which directly affects the primary count.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The rehash method is responsible for resizing and copying the hash table. If there are issues in this method, such as not copying all entries correctly or mishandling the new size, it could lead to incorrect counts in the hash table.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The primaryCount method counts the number of primary entries in the hash table. If the hash table is not correctly populated due to issues in adding names or rehashing, this method will return an incorrect count.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 6,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The calcHash method computes the hash for a given array. If the hash calculation is incorrect, it could lead to improper placement of entries in the hash table, affecting the counts.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The size method returns the current count of entries. While it is straightforward, if the underlying data structure is incorrect due to issues in other methods, it will reflect that.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The bucketCount method simply returns the size of the hash table. It is less likely to be the source of the issue since it does not manipulate data.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The _spilloverStart method calculates an offset based on the hash size. It is unlikely to be the source of the issue since it does not directly affect the counting mechanism.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    }\n]\n```"
