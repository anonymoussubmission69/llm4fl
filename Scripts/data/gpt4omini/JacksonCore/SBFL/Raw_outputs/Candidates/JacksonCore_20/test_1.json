"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testAsEmbedded` is attempting to write an embedded object using the `JsonGenerator` class, specifically calling the method `writeEmbeddedObject(null)`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `JsonGenerationException` is thrown, stating \"No native support for writing embedded objects\". This suggests that the method `writeEmbeddedObject` is likely the source of the issue.\n3. The exception is thrown from the `writeEmbeddedObject` method in the `JsonGenerator` class, which is an abstract method, indicating that the concrete implementation of this method in a subclass is likely where the fault lies.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **Method ID 51**: `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator:writeEmbeddedObject(Ljava/lang/Object;)V` - This is the method that directly throws the exception.\n- **Method ID 54**: `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.JsonGeneratorImpl:<init>(Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/io/IOContext;ILcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/ObjectCodec;)V` - This is the constructor for the `JsonGeneratorImpl`, which may be responsible for setting up the generator.\n- **Method ID 62**: `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.WriterBasedJsonGenerator:<init>(Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/io/IOContext;ILcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/ObjectCodec;Ljava/io/Writer;)V` - This is the constructor for the `WriterBasedJsonGenerator`, which is likely the implementation of `JsonGenerator` being used.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [51, 54, 62]\n}\n```"
