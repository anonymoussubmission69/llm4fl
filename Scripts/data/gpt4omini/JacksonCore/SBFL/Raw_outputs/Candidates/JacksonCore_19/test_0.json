"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testLongerFloatingPoint` is designed to test the parsing of a long floating-point number. The input string is constructed to be a long sequence of '1's followed by '.0', which results in a string of length 201.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred in the method `_parseNumber2` of the `ReaderBasedJsonParser` class. This suggests that the method attempted to access an index in an array that is out of bounds, likely due to the length of the input string.\n3. The methods `_parseNumber2`, `_parseFloat`, and `_parsePosNumber` are directly involved in parsing the number and are likely candidates for the fault.\n4. The method `_testLongerFloat` in the `TestNumericValues` class is also relevant as it is the method that calls the parsing methods.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ReaderBasedJsonParser:_parseNumber2(ZI)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonToken;` (method_id: 66)\n- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ReaderBasedJsonParser:_parseFloat(IIIZI)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonToken;` (method_id: 65)\n- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ReaderBasedJsonParser:_parsePosNumber(I)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonToken;` (method_id: 64)\n- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.TestNumericValues:_testLongerFloat(Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser;Ljava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 580)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [66, 65, 64, 580]\n}\n```"
