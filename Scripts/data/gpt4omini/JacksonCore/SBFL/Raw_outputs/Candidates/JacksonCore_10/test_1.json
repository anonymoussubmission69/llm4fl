"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSyntheticWithBytesNew` is failing due to an assertion that checks the primary count of symbols. The expected value was `8534`, but the actual value was `8524`, indicating a discrepancy of `10`. This suggests that there may be an issue with how names are being added or counted in the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`addName(String name, int[] q, int qlen)`**: This method is responsible for adding names to the canonicalizer and updating the count. If there is an issue in how names are added or counted, it could directly affect the primary count.\n\n2. **`primaryCount()`**: This method counts the primary entries in the hash area. If the count is incorrect, it could lead to the assertion failure.\n\n3. **`rehash()`**: This method is called when the number of entries exceeds a certain threshold. If rehashing is not handled correctly, it could lead to incorrect counts.\n\n4. **`_verifyNeedForRehash()`**: This method checks if rehashing is needed based on the current count. If this logic is flawed, it could prevent necessary rehashing, leading to incorrect counts.\n\n5. **`calcHash(int[] q, int qlen)`**: This method calculates the hash for the given quads. If the hash calculation is incorrect, it could lead to collisions and affect the count.\n\n6. **`bucketCount()`**: This method returns the number of buckets in the hash table. If the bucket count is incorrect, it could affect how names are stored and counted.\n\n7. **`size()`**: This method returns the current size of the canonicalizer. If the size is not updated correctly, it could lead to discrepancies in counts.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potentially suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 4, 10, 13, 6, 0, 3]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the test failure."
