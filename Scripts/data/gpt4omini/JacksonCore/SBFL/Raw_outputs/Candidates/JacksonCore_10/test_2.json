"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCollisionsWithBytesNew187b` is failing due to an assertion that checks the expected bucket count against the actual bucket count returned by the `bucketCount()` method of the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` class. The expected value was `16384`, but the actual value was `32768`. This discrepancy indicates a potential issue in the methods responsible for managing the hash table, particularly those related to resizing and rehashing.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`bucketCount()`**: This method directly returns the `_hashSize`, which is the value being asserted in the test. If the value is incorrect, it could indicate a problem in how the hash table is managed.\n\n2. **`rehash()`**: This method is responsible for resizing the hash table. If there is an issue in how the rehashing is implemented, it could lead to an incorrect bucket count.\n\n3. **`_verifyNeedForRehash()`**: This method checks if a rehash is needed based on the current count and hash size. If this logic is flawed, it could prevent the hash table from resizing correctly.\n\n4. **`_findOffsetForAdd(int hash)`**: This method is involved in adding new entries to the hash table. If it does not handle collisions or resizing properly, it could lead to an incorrect state of the hash table.\n\n5. **`_reportTooManyCollisions()`**: This method is called when there are too many collisions, which could indicate that the hash table is not functioning as expected.\n\n6. **`nukeSymbols(boolean fill)`**: This method resets the state of the hash table. If it is called incorrectly or at the wrong time, it could lead to an incorrect bucket count.\n\n7. **`size()`**: This method returns the current count of entries in the hash table. If this is not accurate, it could affect the behavior of other methods.\n\n8. **`calcHash(int q1)`**: This method calculates the hash for a given input. If the hash calculation is incorrect, it could lead to improper placement of entries in the hash table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 8, 10, 4, 2, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
