"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSymbolTableExpansionBytes` calls the method `_testSymbolTableExpansion`, which is likely responsible for testing the expansion of a symbol table.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred in the method `addName` of `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, specifically at line 824. This suggests that there was an attempt to access an array index that is out of bounds.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include:\n   - `addName` (where the exception occurred)\n   - `findName`\n   - `_parseName`\n   - `_skipString`\n   - `_reportTooManyCollisions`\n   - `_findSecondary`\n   - `createParser`\n   - `_createParser`\n\nGiven these observations, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **addName** - This method is where the exception occurred, indicating a potential issue with how names are added to the symbol table.\n2. **_reportTooManyCollisions** - This method is called when there are too many collisions in the hash table, which could relate to the size of the array being accessed.\n3. **_findSecondary** - This method is involved in finding names in a secondary hash area, which may also relate to the array access.\n4. **findName** - This method is responsible for finding names in the symbol table and may be related to the issue if it interacts with the array incorrectly.\n5. **_parseName** - This method is involved in parsing names and could be related to how names are processed before being added to the symbol table.\n6. **_skipString** - This method is involved in skipping strings and may be related to how input is processed before reaching the symbol table.\n7. **createParser** and **_createParser** - These methods are responsible for creating a parser, which may be involved in the overall process leading to the exception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [19, 20, 1, 8, 12, 2, 5, 6]\n}\n``` \n\nThis list includes methods that are directly involved in the symbol table operations and those that may indirectly affect how names are processed and stored, leading to the observed exception."
