"Based on the analysis of the test and the stack trace, the test failure indicates that the expected bucket count was 16384, but the actual returned value was 32768. This suggests that there is an issue with how the hash table is being resized or how the offsets for adding new entries are calculated.\n\n### Analysis of Methods\n\n1. **rehash()**: This method is responsible for resizing the hash table and copying existing entries. The logic for calculating the new size (`final int newSize = oldSize + oldSize;`) seems incorrect, as it doubles the size without considering the maximum size limit. This could lead to the observed issue of having too many buckets.\n\n2. **_findOffsetForAdd(int hash)**: This method calculates the offset for adding a new entry. If it miscalculates the offsets or does not handle collisions properly, it could lead to incorrect bucket counts. However, it seems less likely to be the primary cause compared to `rehash()`.\n\n3. **_reportTooManyCollisions()**: This method checks for excessive collisions but does not seem to directly affect the bucket count. It is more of a secondary check.\n\n4. **nukeSymbols(boolean fill)**: This method resets the hash table's state. While it could lead to inconsistencies, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the test failure.\n\n5. **_calcTertiaryShift(int primarySlots)**: This method calculates the shift for tertiary slots based on the primary slots. It does not directly affect the bucket count and is less likely to be the cause of the test failure.\n\n6. **bucketCount()**: This method simply returns the current size of the hash table and is the least suspicious.\n\n### Proposed Fixes\n\n1. **rehash()**: \n   - Fix the calculation of `newSize` to ensure it does not exceed `MAX_T_SIZE`. For example, use a more appropriate resizing strategy, such as:\n     ```java\n     final int newSize = Math.min(oldSize * 2, MAX_T_SIZE);\n     ```\n\n2. **_findOffsetForAdd(int hash)**: \n   - Ensure that the method correctly handles collisions and offsets. Review the logic for calculating offsets and ensure that it does not lead to incorrect placements.\n\n3. **_reportTooManyCollisions()**: \n   - Ensure that this method is called appropriately and that it correctly identifies when the hash table is experiencing too many collisions.\n\n4. **nukeSymbols(boolean fill)**: \n   - Ensure that this method is called at the right time and that it correctly resets the state of the hash table.\n\n5. **_calcTertiaryShift(int primarySlots)**: \n   - Review the logic to ensure it correctly calculates the tertiary shift based on the current size of the hash table.\n\n6. **bucketCount()**: \n   - No changes needed as it simply returns the current size.\n\n### Re-Ranking of Methods\n\nBased on the analysis and proposed fixes, the new ranking of suspicious methods is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 2,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 3,\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 4,\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```"
