"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testBinaryAsEmbeddedObject` is attempting to write an embedded object using the `JsonGenerator` class.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `JsonGenerationException` is thrown specifically from the `writeEmbeddedObject` method of the `JsonGenerator` class, which suggests that this method is directly related to the failure.\n3. The exception message states \"No native support for writing embedded objects,\" indicating that the method may not be implemented correctly or is being called inappropriately.\n\nFrom the covered methods by the failed test, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- **`writeEmbeddedObject`**: This is the method that directly caused the exception.\n- **`_createGenerator`**: This method is responsible for creating the `JsonGenerator` instance, which may have implications on how `writeEmbeddedObject` behaves.\n- **`createGenerator`**: This method is a public interface to create a generator, and it calls `_createGenerator`, making it relevant to the flow leading to the failure.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3]\n}\n``` \n\n- **Method ID 0**: `writeEmbeddedObject` - Directly responsible for the exception.\n- **Method ID 1**: `_createGenerator` - Responsible for creating the generator instance.\n- **Method ID 3**: `createGenerator` - Public method that initiates the generator creation process."
