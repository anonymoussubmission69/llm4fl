"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testShortNameCollisionsDirectNew` is failing due to an assertion that expected the bucket count to be 1024, but it was actually 2048. This indicates that there may be an issue with the method responsible for managing the hash table's size or rehashing logic.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **rehash()** - This method is responsible for resizing the hash table and could be the source of the incorrect bucket count.\n2. **_findOffsetForAdd(int hash)** - This method calculates the offset for adding a new entry and may be involved in how entries are placed in the hash table.\n3. **nukeSymbols(boolean fill)** - This method resets the symbol table and could affect the count of symbols if not handled correctly.\n4. **size()** - This method returns the current count of symbols, which is directly related to the assertion that failed.\n5. **_verifyNeedForRehash()** - This method checks if a rehash is needed based on the current count and could be related to the incorrect bucket count.\n6. **bucketCount()** - This method returns the current size of the hash table, which is the value that failed the assertion.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 18]\n}\n```"
