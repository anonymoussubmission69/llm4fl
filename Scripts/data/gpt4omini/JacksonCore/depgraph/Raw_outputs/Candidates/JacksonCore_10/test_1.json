"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSyntheticWithBytesNew` is failing due to an assertion that checks the primary count of symbols. The expected value was `8534`, but the actual value was `8524`, indicating a discrepancy of `10`. This suggests that there may be an issue with how names are being added to the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, particularly in the methods responsible for calculating hashes and managing the internal state of the symbol table.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **rehash()** - This method is responsible for resizing the hash table and may affect how names are stored and counted.\n2. **calcHash(int[] q, int qlen)** - This method calculates the hash for an array of quads, which is critical for determining where names are stored in the hash table.\n3. **addName(String name, int[] q, int qlen)** - This method adds a name to the symbol table and is directly involved in the counting of names.\n4. **_findOffsetForAdd(int hash)** - This method finds the appropriate offset for adding a new name based on its hash, which could lead to incorrect placements if there's an issue.\n5. **_verifyNeedForRehash()** - This method checks if a rehash is needed, which could affect the integrity of the symbol table if not functioning correctly.\n6. **primaryCount()** - This method counts the primary entries in the hash table and is directly related to the failing assertion.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12]\n}\n```"
