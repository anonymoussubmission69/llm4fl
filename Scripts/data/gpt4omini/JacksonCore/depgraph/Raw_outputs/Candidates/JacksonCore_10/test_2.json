"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCollisionsWithBytesNew187b` is failing due to an assertion that checks the expected bucket count against the actual bucket count. The expected value is `16384`, but the actual value returned is `32768`. This indicates that there may be an issue with the rehashing logic or the way the bucket count is calculated.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **rehash()** - This method is responsible for resizing the hash table and could be the source of the incorrect bucket count.\n2. **_findOffsetForAdd(int hash)** - This method determines where to add new entries in the hash table, which could affect the bucket count.\n3. **_reportTooManyCollisions()** - This method checks for collision thresholds and may influence when rehashing occurs.\n4. **nukeSymbols(boolean fill)** - This method resets the symbol table, which could impact the state of the hash table.\n5. **_calcTertiaryShift(int primarySlots)** - This method calculates the tertiary shift, which is relevant for determining the size of the hash table.\n6. **bucketCount()** - This method returns the current bucket count and is directly involved in the failing assertion.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 20]\n}\n```"
