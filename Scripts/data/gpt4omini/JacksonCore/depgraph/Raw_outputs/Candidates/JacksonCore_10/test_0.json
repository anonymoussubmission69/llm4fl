"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer.addName(String name, int[] q, int qlen)** - This method is responsible for adding names to the canonicalizer. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred, which could be related to how names are added and managed in the internal array.\n\n2. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer.rehash()** - This method is called to resize the internal hash area when the number of entries exceeds a certain threshold. If the rehashing logic is flawed, it could lead to issues when adding new names.\n\n3. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer.calcHash(int[] q, int qlen)** - This method calculates the hash for the given quads. If the hash calculation is incorrect, it could lead to improper indexing in the internal array.\n\n4. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer.findName(int[] q, int qlen)** - This method is responsible for finding names based on the quads. If the logic for finding names is incorrect, it could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n5. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer._findOffsetForAdd(int hash)** - This method determines the offset for adding a new name based on the hash. If the offset calculation is incorrect, it could lead to out-of-bounds errors.\n\n6. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer._calcOffset(int hash)** - This method calculates the index in the hash area based on the hash. If the calculation is incorrect, it could lead to accessing invalid indices.\n\n7. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer._findSecondary(int origOffset, int q1)** - This method is used to find secondary entries in the hash area. If the logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect lookups.\n\n8. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer.nukeSymbols(boolean fill)** - This method resets the canonicalizer. If it does not properly manage the internal state, it could lead to inconsistencies.\n\nGiven the nature of the error and the methods involved, these methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [4, 11, 2, 3, 5, 6, 1, 8]\n}\n```"
