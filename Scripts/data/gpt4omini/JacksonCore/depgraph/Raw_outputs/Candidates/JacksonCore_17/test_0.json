"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious:\n\n1. **_writeSegmentedRaw**: This method is involved in writing raw characters and is likely where the error originates, as it is directly mentioned in the stack trace.\n2. **_outputSurrogates**: This method handles surrogate pairs, which are relevant when dealing with characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). The error could be related to how surrogates are processed.\n3. **_outputRawMultiByteChar**: This method is responsible for outputting multi-byte characters and includes a check for split surrogates, which is directly related to the error message in the stack trace.\n4. **writeRaw**: This method is a public interface for writing raw characters and calls the aforementioned methods. It could be a point of failure if it does not handle inputs correctly.\n5. **writeRaw(String text, int offset, int len)**: This method converts a string to a character array and calls `writeRaw`, making it relevant to the input that leads to the error.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and the fault may propagate through them. \n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n```"
