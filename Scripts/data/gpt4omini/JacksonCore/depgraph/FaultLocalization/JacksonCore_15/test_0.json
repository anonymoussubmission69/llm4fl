    "final_full_answer": "Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the test `testNotAllowMultipleMatches` is failing because it expected the value `3` but received `4`. This indicates that there is an issue with how the filtering is being applied in the parsing logic, particularly with the handling of the `TokenFilter`.\n\nThe methods provided seem to be related to parsing JSON tokens and applying filters. The suspicious methods are likely those that deal with token filtering and context management, as they directly influence the output of the parsing process.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is responsible for retrieving the next token while applying the current filter context.
