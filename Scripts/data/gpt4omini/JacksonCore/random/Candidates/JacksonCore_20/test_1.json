    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testAsEmbedded` is attempting to write an embedded object using the `JsonGenerator` class, specifically calling the method `writeEmbeddedObject(null)`.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `JsonGenerationException` is thrown, stating \"No native support for writing embedded objects\". This suggests that the method `writeEmbeddedObject` is not handling the input as expected, leading to the exception.\n3. The exception originates from the `writeEmbeddedObject` method in the `JsonGenerator` class, which is abstract and likely implemented in a subclass.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator:writeEmbeddedObject(Ljava/lang/Object;)V`** - This is the method that directly caused the exception.\n2. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator:<init>()V`** - The constructor of the `JsonGenerator` class, which may influence how the generator is set up.\n3. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.WriterBasedJsonGenerator:<init>(Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/io/IOContext;ILcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/ObjectCodec;Ljava/io/Writer;)V`** - This is a specific implementation of `JsonGenerator` that may have its own initialization logic affecting the behavior of `writeEmbeddedObject`.\n\nNow, I will summarize the findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [51, 50, 62]\n}\n```"
