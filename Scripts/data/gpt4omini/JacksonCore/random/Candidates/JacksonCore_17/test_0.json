    "final_ans": "Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following methods are identified as suspicious and potentially leading to the fault:\n\n1. **`writeRaw`** (Method ID: 72) - This method is responsible for writing raw characters to the output. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs during the writing process, specifically when handling surrogate characters.\n\n2. **`_writeSegmentedRaw`** (Method ID: 73) - This method is called within `writeRaw` and is responsible for handling the segmented writing of raw characters. It is likely involved in the error related to surrogate handling.\n\n3. **`_outputRawMultiByteChar`** (Method ID: 76) - This method is directly mentioned in the error message regarding the \"Split surrogate on writeRaw() input.\" It is crucial to analyze this method to understand how it processes multi-byte characters and surrogates.\n\n4. **`_outputSurrogates`** (Method ID: 77) - This method is responsible for outputting surrogate pairs. Given the nature of the error, it is essential to investigate how this method handles surrogates and whether it contributes to the fault.\n\n5. **`_reportError`** (Method ID: 59) - This method is invoked when an error occurs, specifically in the context of surrogate handling. While it may not be the source of the fault, it is important to understand its role in error reporting.\n\nThe following JSON object summarizes the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [72, 73, 76, 77, 59]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test case."
