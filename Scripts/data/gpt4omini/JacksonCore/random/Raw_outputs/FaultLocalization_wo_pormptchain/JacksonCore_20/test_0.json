"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, the following methods are ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'writeEmbeddedObject' is directly related to the failure, as the exception indicates that there is no native support for writing embedded objects. This method is likely where the fault originates.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 54,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'JsonGeneratorImpl' constructor initializes the generator and may be responsible for setting up the context in which 'writeEmbeddedObject' is called. If there are issues in the setup, it could lead to the failure observed.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 5,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The 'createGenerator' method is responsible for creating a JsonGenerator instance. If this method does not properly configure the generator, it could lead to the failure when trying to write embedded objects.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 0,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The default constructor of 'JsonFactory' initializes the factory.
