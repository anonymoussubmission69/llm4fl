"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 75,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getTokenLocation() is responsible for returning the location of the current token. Since the test is failing due to an assertion on the byte offset, this method is highly suspicious as it directly relates to the offset being tested.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 81,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getByteOffset() returns the byte offset of the current location. The test failure indicates that the expected byte offset was 0, but the actual was 3, making this method very relevant to the issue.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 76,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method nextToken() is responsible for advancing to the next token in the JSON input. If this method does not correctly handle whitespace or padding, it could lead to incorrect offsets being reported.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 78,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _skipWSOrEnd() is responsible for skipping whitespace or determining the end of input. If this method does not correctly skip the expected whitespace, it could affect the token location and thus the byte offset.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
