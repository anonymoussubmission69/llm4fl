"Based on the provided test body and the stack trace, the test `testOffsetWithObjectFieldsUsingReader` is failing due to an assertion that expected a character offset of `6`, but received `1`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the character offsets are being calculated or returned in the `JsonParser` class.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 70,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method getTokenLocation() is responsible for returning the location of the current token, including the character offset. Since the test is failing due to an incorrect character offset, this method is highly suspicious.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 71,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _updateLocation() updates the token input total and the current input row and column. If this method is not correctly updating the location information, it could lead to incorrect offsets being reported.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 66,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _nextAfterName() is involved in parsing the next token after a name. If there is an issue in how it processes tokens, it could affect the offsets reported by getTokenLocation().\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 67,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _parseName() is responsible for parsing names in the JSON input. If it incorrectly processes names, it could lead to incorrect offsets being calculated.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 68,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _skipColon() is involved in skipping over colons in the JSON input. If it does not correctly handle the input, it could also affect the offsets.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    }\n]\n``` \n\nThese methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in calculating or reporting the character offsets in the JSON parsing process."
