"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 106,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'nextToken()' in 'JsonParserSequence' is responsible for retrieving the next token from the parser sequence. The test fails when it expects the integer value '2' but receives '3', indicating that the token parsing logic may not be correctly handling the input sequence.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 105,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'createFlattened()' in 'JsonParserSequence' creates a new parser sequence from two parsers. If the sequence creation logic is flawed, it could lead to incorrect token parsing, which might explain the discrepancy in expected and actual values.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 104,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of 'JsonParserSequence' initializes the parser sequence. If there are issues with how the parsers are initialized or if they are not set up correctly, it could lead to incorrect behavior in subsequent token retrieval.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 73,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getIntValue()' in 'ParserBase' retrieves the integer value from the current token. If the token parsing logic has already failed, this method may return an incorrect value, contributing to the test failure.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
