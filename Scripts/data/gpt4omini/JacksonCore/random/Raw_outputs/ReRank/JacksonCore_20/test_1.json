"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, as well as the method bodies retrieved, here is the re-ranking of the methods along with potential fixes:\n\n1. **Method ID 51 (`writeEndArray`)**: This method is abstract and is likely intended to be implemented in a subclass. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs when trying to write an embedded object, which suggests that the implementation of this method may not handle embedded objects correctly. This makes it highly suspicious as it could lead to the `JsonGenerationException` seen in the test. \n\n   **Potential Fix**: Ensure that the subclass implementing `writeEndArray` correctly handles embedded objects. If embedded objects are not supported, provide a clear exception message or handle them appropriately.\n\n2. **Method ID 50 (`JsonGenerator` constructor)**: The constructor does not contain any logic that would directly cause the exception. However, since it initializes the `JsonGenerator`, any issues in the initialization could lead to problems later on. It is less suspicious than method 51 but still relevant as it sets up the context for the generator's behavior.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: Review the initialization logic to ensure that all necessary configurations for handling embedded objects are set up correctly. If the constructor is not setting up the necessary state for handling embedded objects, consider adding that logic.\n\n3. **Method ID 62**: This method contains static final variables and does not have any executable logic that would directly cause the exception. It is more about configuration and constants, making it the least suspicious of the three methods. It does not directly relate to the functionality that is failing in the test.\n\n   **Potential Fix**: No immediate fix is required for this method as it does not contribute to the exception. However, ensure that the constants are correctly used in the implementation of methods that handle JSON generation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the new ranking of suspiciousness is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 62,\n        \"rank\": 3\n    }\n]\n```"
