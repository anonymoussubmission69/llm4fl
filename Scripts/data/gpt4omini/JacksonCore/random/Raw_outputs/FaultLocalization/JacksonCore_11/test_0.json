"Based on the analysis of the test and stack trace, the primary issue appears to be an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurring in the `addName` method. This suggests that there may be an issue with how the method calculates offsets or manages the hash area, particularly when adding names to the symbol table.\n\nHere is the ranking of the methods from most suspicious to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 44,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The addName method is directly involved in adding names to the symbol table and is likely where the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException originates. It manipulates the hash area and offsets, which could lead to out-of-bounds access if not handled correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 47,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The _findOffsetForAdd method calculates the offset for adding a new entry in the hash area. If this method returns an incorrect offset, it could lead to out-of-bounds access in the addName method.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 45,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The _verifyNeedForRehash method checks if rehashing is needed based on the count of entries. If the count is not managed correctly, it could lead to incorrect offsets being calculated in the addName method.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 50,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The _reportTooManyCollisions method is related to handling collisions in the hash table. If collisions are not managed properly, it could lead to incorrect state in the hash area, affecting the addName method.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 54,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The createInitial method initializes the TableInfo object, which includes setting up the hash area. If the initial size is incorrect, it could lead to out-of-bounds access later.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 52,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The TableInfo constructor initializes the object with various parameters. If any of these parameters are incorrect, it could lead to issues in the methods that manipulate the hash area.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 53,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The TableInfo copy constructor initializes a new TableInfo object from an existing one. If the source object is in an invalid state, it could propagate issues.\",\n        \"rank\": 7\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 51,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The _calcTertiaryShift method calculates the tertiary shift for the hash table. While it may not directly cause the exception, incorrect calculations could lead to issues in offset calculations.\",\n        \"rank\": 8\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 118,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The _isNextTokenNameYes method is involved in parsing tokens but is less likely to be directly related to the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. It may be indirectly related if it affects the input buffer size.\",\n        \"rank\": 9\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 119,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Similar to method 118, this method is involved in parsing but is less likely to be the source of the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. It may be indirectly related.\",\n        \"rank\": 10\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 117,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is also involved in parsing tokens and is the least likely to be related to the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. It may be indirectly related but is not a primary suspect.\",\n        \"rank\": 11\n    }\n]\n```"
