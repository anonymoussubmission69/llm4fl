"Based on the provided stack trace and the method bodies retrieved, I will analyze the methods and rank them according to their suspiciousness regarding the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` that occurred during the test.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Stack Trace Insights**:\n   - The exception `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 200` indicates that there was an attempt to access an index of an array that is out of bounds, specifically at index 200.\n   - The methods involved in the stack trace are:\n     - `_parseNumber2` (method_id: 1418)\n     - `_parseFloat` (method_id: 1266)\n     - `nextToken` (method_id: 705)\n\n2. **Method Bodies**:\n   - The method bodies for method_ids 1418, 1266, and 705 were not found, but we have partial bodies for method_ids 64, 65, and 66.\n   - The methods `_isNextTokenNameYes` (method_id: 65 and 66) seem to deal with parsing numbers and handling input buffers, which could be related to the parsing logic that led to the exception.\n\n### Ranking of Methods\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1266,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is directly involved in parsing floats and is part of the stack trace where the exception occurred. It likely handles the input that leads to the out-of-bounds access.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 1418,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is also part of the stack trace and is responsible for parsing numbers. It is likely that the logic here is flawed, leading to the out-of-bounds access.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 705,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is part of the stack trace and is responsible for tokenizing input. If it does not correctly handle the input size, it could lead to the out-of-bounds error.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 64,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is related to token handling but does not directly appear in the stack trace. It may still be involved in the overall parsing logic.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 65,\n        \"reasoning\": \"This method is involved in parsing numbers and handling input buffers. It may contribute to the parsing logic but is less directly related to the exception.\",\n        \"rank\": 5\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 66,\n        \"reasoning\": \"Similar to method_id 65, this method is involved in parsing but does not directly relate to the exception. It is less suspicious than the others.\",\n        \"rank\": 6\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThe methods are ranked based on their direct involvement in the stack trace and their potential to cause the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The methods that are directly involved in parsing numbers and handling input are ranked higher in suspicion."
