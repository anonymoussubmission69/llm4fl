"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testWonkyNumber173` is attempting to compile a `JsonPointer` with the input string `\"1e0\"`, which is a representation of a number in scientific notation.\n2. The stack trace indicates that a `NumberFormatException` is thrown when trying to parse this string into an integer. This exception occurs in the `parseInt` method of the `NumberInput` class.\n3. The `JsonPointer` class has methods that deal with parsing indices and tails, which may also be involved in the process of handling the input string.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.io.NumberInput:parseInt(Ljava/lang/String;)I`** - This method is directly involved in parsing the string and is where the exception is thrown.\n2. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer:compile(Ljava/lang/String;)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonPointer;`** - This method is responsible for compiling the `JsonPointer` and may be where the input string is initially processed.\n3. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer:_parseIndex(Ljava/lang/String;)I`** - This method is called during the parsing process and may contribute to the handling of the input string.\n4. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer:_parseTail(Ljava/lang/String;)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonPointer;`** - This method may also be involved in the parsing logic and should be reviewed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 5, 6, 7]\n}\n```"
