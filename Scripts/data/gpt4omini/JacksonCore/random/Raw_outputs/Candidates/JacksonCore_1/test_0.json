"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testAllowNaN()` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that an expected exception was not thrown. The error message suggests that the code is expected to handle a case where a value cannot be represented as a `BigDecimal`, but instead, it received a `null` message.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed are those related to parsing and handling numeric values, particularly those that deal with `NaN` (Not a Number) values. The following methods are of particular interest:\n\n1. **`resetAsNaN(String valueStr, double value)`** - This method is responsible for resetting the parser state when a `NaN` value is encountered. If this method does not handle `NaN` correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n2. **`getDoubleValue()`** - This method retrieves the double value from the parser. If it does not correctly handle the state when `NaN` is present, it could also lead to the failure.\n3. **`getDecimalValue()`** - Similar to `getDoubleValue()`, this method converts the number to a `BigDecimal`. If it does not handle `NaN` correctly, it could result in the failure.\n4. **`convertNumberToBigDecimal()`** - This method is responsible for converting a number to a `BigDecimal`. If it does not handle `NaN` correctly, it could lead to the failure.\n\nThese methods are likely to be interconnected, as they deal with the parsing and conversion of numeric values, which is central to the test case that is failing.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [71, 72, 73, 74]\n}\n```"
