"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCollisionsWithBytesNew187b` is failing due to an assertion that checks the expected bucket count against the actual bucket count. The expected value is `16384`, but the actual value is `32768`. This indicates a potential issue in the method responsible for calculating or managing the bucket count in the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` class.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`bucketCount()`** - This method directly returns the `_hashSize`, which is the value being asserted in the test. If the bucket count is incorrect, this method is a primary suspect.\n   \n2. **`rehash()`** - This method is responsible for resizing the hash table and could affect the bucket count if it is not functioning correctly.\n\n3. **`createRoot(int seed)`** - This method initializes the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` and could influence the initial bucket count.\n\n4. **`makeChild(int flags)`** - This method creates a child `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, and if the parent has an incorrect bucket count, it could propagate to the child.\n\n5. **`_verifyNeedForRehash()`** - This method checks if rehashing is needed based on the current count and size, which could impact the bucket count if it is not functioning correctly.\n\n6. **`_calcTertiaryShift(int primarySlots)`** - This method calculates the tertiary shift based on the primary slots, which could indirectly affect the bucket count.\n\n7. **`addName(String name, int[] quads, int length)`** - This method is called in the test and could affect the internal state of the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, potentially leading to an incorrect bucket count.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 16, 7, 8, 12, 20, 14]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
