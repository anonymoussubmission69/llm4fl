"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSyntheticWithBytesNew` is failing due to an assertion that checks the primary count of symbols against an expected value. The stack trace indicates that the expected value was 8534, but the actual value was 8524, leading to an `AssertionFailedError`.\n\nThe methods that are covered by the failed test and could potentially be suspicious include:\n\n1. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer.addName**: This method is responsible for adding names to the canonicalizer and could be where the count discrepancy arises.\n2. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer.primaryCount**: This method calculates the primary count, which is directly related to the assertion that failed.\n3. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer._verifyNeedForRehash**: This method checks if rehashing is needed, which could affect the count if the hash table is not managed correctly.\n4. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer._verifySharing**: This method ensures that the hash area is shared correctly, which could also impact the count if not handled properly.\n5. **ByteQuadsCanonicalizer.rehash**: This method is responsible for rehashing the entries, which could lead to discrepancies in counts if not implemented correctly.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [12, 26, 13, 14, 17]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the discrepancy in the primary count."
