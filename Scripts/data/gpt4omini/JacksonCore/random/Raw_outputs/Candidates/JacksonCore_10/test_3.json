"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testShortNameCollisionsDirectNew` is failing due to an assertion that expected the `bucketCount()` to return 1024, but it returned 2048 instead. This indicates a potential issue in the method that calculates or manages the bucket count in the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` class.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`bucketCount()`** - This method directly returns the bucket count, which is the subject of the failing assertion.\n2. **`rehash()`** - This method is responsible for resizing and rehashing the internal structures, which could affect the bucket count.\n3. **`createRoot(int seed)`** - This method initializes the root `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, and any issues in its initialization could lead to incorrect bucket counts.\n4. **`makeChild(int flags)`** - This method creates a child `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, and if the parent has an incorrect bucket count, it may propagate to the child.\n5. **`size()`** - This method returns the size of the canonicalizer, which may be related to how the bucket count is calculated.\n6. **`_verifyNeedForRehash()`** - This method checks if rehashing is needed, which could impact the bucket count if it is not functioning correctly.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and issues in one could lead to failures in others, especially in the context of managing the internal state of the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 16, 7, 8, 9, 12]\n}\n```"
