"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOffsetWithInputOffset` is failing due to an assertion that expected a byte offset of `0` but received `3`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the byte offset is being calculated or returned in the `JsonLocation` class.\n\nThe stack trace points to the following line in the test:\n```java\nassertEquals(0L, loc.getByteOffset());\n```\nThis suggests that the method `getByteOffset()` in the `JsonLocation` class is critical to investigate.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several constructors and methods from the `JsonFactory`, `JsonParser`, and `JsonLocation` classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory:createParser([BII)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser;`** - This method is responsible for creating a parser, and it is likely involved in the process that leads to the creation of the `JsonLocation` object.\n2. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ByteSourceJsonBootstrapper:constructParser(ILcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/ObjectCodec;Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/BytesToNameCanonicalizer;Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/CharsToNameCanonicalizer;ZZ)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser;`** - This method constructs the parser and may influence how the byte offset is calculated.\n3. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonLocation:getByteOffset()J`** - This method directly returns the byte offset, which is the source of the failure in the test.\n4. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser:nextToken()Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonToken;`** - This method is responsible for advancing the parser to the next token, which may affect the state of the `JsonLocation`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 70, 81, 76]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
