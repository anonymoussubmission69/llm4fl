"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSymbolTableExpansionBytes` calls the method `_testSymbolTableExpansion`, which is located in the `SymbolsViaParserTest` class. This method is likely responsible for testing the expansion of the symbol table.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred in the `addName` method of the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` class. This suggests that there may be an issue with how names are being added to the symbol table, potentially due to an incorrect index being accessed.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace that need to be analyzed include:\n   - `addName` in `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` (method_id: 44)\n   - `_calcOffset` in `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` (method_id: 42)\n   - `findName` in `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` (method_id: 41)\n   - `_findOffsetForAdd` in `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` (method_id: 47)\n   - `_verifyNeedForRehash` in `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` (method_id: 45)\n   - `_verifySharing` in `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` (method_id: 46)\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault leading to the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47]\n}\n```"
