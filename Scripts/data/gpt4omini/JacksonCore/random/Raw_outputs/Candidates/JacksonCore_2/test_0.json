"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMangledNumbersBytes` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that an exception was expected but instead a token of type `VALUE_NUMBER_INT` was received. This suggests that the parsing logic is not handling certain input correctly, likely related to the JSON parsing process.\n\nThe stack trace points to the method `_testMangledNumbers` in the `TestParserErrorHandling` class, which is likely responsible for testing the parsing of mangled numbers. This method is crucial as it directly relates to the failure.\n\nThe covered methods by the failed test include several constructors and methods from the `JsonFactory`, `JsonParser`, and related classes. The following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory:createParser(Ljava/io/InputStream;)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser;`** - This method is responsible for creating a parser from an input stream, which is likely where the input is being processed.\n2. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ByteSourceJsonBootstrapper:constructParser(ILcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/ObjectCodec;Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/BytesToNameCanonicalizer;Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/CharsToNameCanonicalizer;ZZ)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser;`** - This method constructs a parser and may be involved in the parsing logic that leads to the error.\n3. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.UTF8StreamJsonParser:_parseNumber(I)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonToken;`** - This method is responsible for parsing numbers, which is directly related to the error encountered (VALUE_NUMBER_INT).\n4. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.UTF8StreamJsonParser:nextToken()Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonToken;`** - This method retrieves the next token from the parser, which could also be involved in the failure.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and likely contribute to the parsing logic that is failing in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 75, 84, 82]\n}\n```"
