The test `testSymbolTableExpansionBytes` is failing due to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at line 824 in the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer.addName` method. This indicates that there is an attempt to access an array index that is out of bounds, which is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.\n\n2. The stack trace shows that the failure occurs during the execution of the `addName` method, which is responsible for adding names to a symbol table. This method is likely to be the primary suspect for the failure.\n\n3. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various constructors and methods related to `JsonFactory`, `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, and `CharsToNameCanonicalizer`. However, the most relevant methods to investigate further are those related to the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, especially the `addName`, `_verifyNeedForRehash`, and `_findOffsetForAdd` methods, as they are directly involved in managing the symbol table and could be contributing to the out-of-bounds access.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following methods are identified as suspicious and need further investigation:\n\n- `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:addName(Ljava/lang/String;[II)Ljava/lang/String;` (method_id: 44)\n- `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:_verifyNeedForRehash()V` (method_id: 45)\n- `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:_findOffsetForAdd(I)I` (method_id: 47)\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [44, 45, 47]\n}\n```"
