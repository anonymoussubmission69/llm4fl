"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSyntheticWithBytesNew` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected primary count is 8534, but the actual count is 8524. This indicates that there is a discrepancy in the counting mechanism within the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` class, particularly in the methods that handle the addition and counting of names.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`addName(String name, int[] q, int qlen)`** - This method is responsible for adding names to the canonicalizer and updating the count. Any issues in this method could directly affect the primary count.\n2. **`primaryCount()`** - This method counts the primary entries. If there is an issue in how it counts, it could lead to the discrepancy observed in the test.\n3. **`_verifyNeedForRehash()`** - This method checks if rehashing is needed based on the count. If rehashing is not handled correctly, it could affect the count.\n4. **`_verifySharing()`** - This method ensures that the hash area is not shared. If sharing is not handled properly, it could lead to incorrect counts.\n5. **`rehash()`** - This method is responsible for rehashing the entries. If there are issues during rehashing, it could lead to incorrect counts.\n6. **`calcHash(int[] q, int qlen)`** - This method calculates the hash for the given quads. If the hash calculation is incorrect, it could lead to incorrect placements in the hash table, affecting the count.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [12, 26, 13, 14, 17, 30]\n}\n```"
