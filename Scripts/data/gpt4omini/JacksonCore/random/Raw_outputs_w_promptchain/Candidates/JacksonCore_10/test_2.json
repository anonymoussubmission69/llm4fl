"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCollisionsWithBytesNew187b` is failing due to an assertion that checks the expected bucket count against the actual bucket count. The expected value is `16384`, but the actual value returned is `32768`. This indicates a potential issue in the methods related to the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` class, particularly those that deal with the size and management of the hash table.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:bucketCount()`** - This method directly returns the `_hashSize`, which is the value being asserted in the test. If the bucket count is incorrect, this method is a primary suspect.\n   \n2. **`ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:rehash()`** - This method is responsible for resizing the hash table and could potentially lead to an incorrect bucket count if it is not functioning as expected.\n\n3. **`ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:createRoot(int)`** - This method initializes the root of the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, and if the initial size is incorrect, it could lead to an incorrect bucket count.\n\n4. **`ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:size()`** - This method returns the count of entries in the canonicalizer, which may also be related to the bucket count.\n\n5. **`ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:_verifyNeedForRehash()`** - This method checks if a rehash is needed based on the current count and size, which could affect the bucket count if it is not functioning correctly.\n\n6. **`ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:_calcTertiaryShift(int)`** - This method calculates the tertiary shift based on the primary slots, which could influence how the hash table is structured.\n\n7. **`ByteQuadsCanonicalizer:calcHash(int)`** - This method calculates the hash for a given input, which could affect how entries are distributed across the buckets.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 16, 7, 9, 12, 20, 15]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to determine the root cause of the failure in the test."
