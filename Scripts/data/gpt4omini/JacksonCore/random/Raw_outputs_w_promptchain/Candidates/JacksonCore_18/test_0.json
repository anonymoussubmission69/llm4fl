"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testTooBigBigDecimal` is designed to check the behavior of the `JsonGenerator` when attempting to write a `BigDecimal` that exceeds the allowed limits. The test fails when it tries to write `1E+10000`, which should throw a `JsonGenerationException`, but instead, it does not, leading to an assertion failure.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.WriterBasedJsonGenerator:writeNumber(Ljava/math/BigDecimal;)V` (method_id: 80)** - This method is responsible for writing a `BigDecimal` value. Since the test fails when trying to write a too-large `BigDecimal`, this method is critical to investigate.\n\n2. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.WriterBasedJsonGenerator:_verifyValueWrite(Ljava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 81)** - This method verifies if a value can be written. It may contain logic that prevents writing certain values, and if it fails to do so, it could lead to the observed issue.\n\n3. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.WriterBasedJsonGenerator:writeRaw(Ljava/lang/String;)V` (method_id: 78)** - This method is involved in writing raw strings, which may be relevant if the `writeNumber` method calls it under certain conditions.\n\n4. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.WriterBasedJsonGenerator:_flushBuffer()V` (method_id: 84)** - This method handles flushing the output buffer, which could be relevant if the writing process does not handle exceptions correctly.\n\n5. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.WriterBasedJsonGenerator:close()V` (method_id: 82)** - The close method may also be relevant if it interacts with the writing process in a way that could suppress exceptions.\n\n6. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator:writeNumber(Ljava/math/BigDecimal;)V` (method_id: 80)** - This is the public interface for writing a `BigDecimal`, and it may have additional checks or logic that could affect the outcome.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [80, 81, 78, 84, 82]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to determine why the expected exception is not being thrown when writing a `BigDecimal` that exceeds the limits."
