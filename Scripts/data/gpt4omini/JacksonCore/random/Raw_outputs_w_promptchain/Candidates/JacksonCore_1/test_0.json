"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testAllowNaN` is failing because it expected an exception with a specific message but received a `null` message instead. This indicates that there might be an issue with how exceptions are being thrown or handled in the code related to parsing numbers, particularly NaN (Not a Number) values.\n\nThe stack trace points to the method `_testAllowNaN` in the `TestParserNonStandard` class, which suggests that the issue is likely related to the parsing logic for NaN values.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ReaderBasedJsonParser:_handleUnexpectedValue(int)`** - This method is responsible for handling unexpected values, including NaN. The logic here may not be correctly identifying or throwing the expected exception for NaN values.\n   \n2. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.base.ParserBase:convertNumberToBigDecimal()`** - This method converts numbers to BigDecimal. If NaN is not handled correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\n3. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.base.ParserBase:getDecimalValue()`** - This method retrieves the decimal value and may also be involved in handling NaN values.\n\n4. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ReaderBasedJsonParser:loadMore()`** - This method is responsible for loading more data into the parser. If it fails to load or parse NaN correctly, it could lead to the issue.\n\n5. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ReaderBasedJsonParser:getText()`** - This method retrieves the text representation of the current token. If the token is NaN and not handled properly, it could return null.\n\n6. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ReaderBasedJsonParser:_getText2(JsonToken)`** - Similar to `getText()`, this method may also be involved in handling the text representation of tokens, including NaN.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [82, 74, 73, 76, 79, 80]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to determine why the expected exception is not being thrown when encountering NaN values."
