"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testEmpty()` is failing due to a `NullPointerException` at line 83, which indicates that the method `getTextBuffer()` is likely returning `null`. This suggests that there may be an issue with the state of the `TextBuffer` object or its dependencies, particularly the `BufferRecycler`.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are suspicious:\n\n1. **BufferRecycler Constructor** (`BufferRecycler()`) - This method initializes the `BufferRecycler` object. If it is not properly initialized, it could lead to issues in the `TextBuffer`.\n2. **BufferRecycler Constructor with Parameters** (`BufferRecycler(int, int)`) - This method initializes the buffer arrays. If the parameters are incorrect or if the arrays are not properly allocated, it could lead to a `NullPointerException`.\n3. **TextBuffer Constructor** (`TextBuffer(BufferRecycler)`) - This method initializes the `TextBuffer` with a `BufferRecycler`. If the `BufferRecycler` is not properly initialized, it could lead to issues in the `TextBuffer`.\n4. **resetWithEmpty()** - This method resets the `TextBuffer` to an empty state. If it does not handle the internal state correctly, it could lead to a `NullPointerException` when calling `getTextBuffer()`.\n5. **getTextBuffer()** - This method is directly involved in the failure, as it is where the `NullPointerException` occurs. It needs to be analyzed to understand why it is returning `null`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the suspicious methods are ranked as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
