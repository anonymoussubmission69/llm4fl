"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOffsetWithInputOffset` is failing due to an assertion that expected a byte offset of `0` but received `3`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the byte offset is being calculated or returned in the `JsonParser` class.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`createParser(byte[] data, int offset, int len)`** - This method is responsible for creating a parser with the given byte array and offsets. Any issues in how it initializes the parser could lead to incorrect offsets.\n   \n2. **`_createParser(byte[] data, int offset, int len, IOContext ctxt)`** - This method is called by `createParser` and is responsible for the actual creation of the parser. It may also influence how offsets are calculated.\n\n3. **`getTokenLocation()`** - This method is called to retrieve the token location, which includes the byte offset. If this method is not correctly calculating or returning the offset, it would directly affect the test's outcome.\n\n4. **`getByteOffset()`** - This method is specifically responsible for returning the byte offset. If there is a bug in this method, it would directly cause the test to fail.\n\n5. **`nextToken()`** - This method is responsible for advancing to the next token, and it may affect the state of the parser, including the offsets.\n\n6. **`_skipWSOrEnd()`** - This method is responsible for skipping whitespace or the end of the input, which could also affect how the offsets are calculated.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 6, 75, 81, 76, 78]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
