"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBinaryAsEmbeddedObject` is failing due to a `JsonGenerationException` that indicates \"No native support for writing embedded objects.\" This exception is thrown from the `writeEmbeddedObject` method of the `JsonGenerator` class.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs when the `writeEmbeddedObject` method is called, which suggests that this method is directly related to the failure. The test also involves the creation of a `JsonGenerator` instance, which is done through the `createGenerator` method of the `JsonFactory` class.\n\nGiven this information, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`writeEmbeddedObject`** (method_id: 51) - This is the method that throws the exception.\n2. **`createGenerator`** (method_id: 5) - This method is responsible for creating the `JsonGenerator` instance that is used in the test.\n3. **`_createGenerator`** (method_id: 6) - This method is called by `createGenerator` and may have additional logic that could affect the creation of the `JsonGenerator`.\n4. **`JsonFactory` constructor methods** (method_ids: 0, 1, 2) - These methods initialize the `JsonFactory` and may influence how the `JsonGenerator` is configured.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [51, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
