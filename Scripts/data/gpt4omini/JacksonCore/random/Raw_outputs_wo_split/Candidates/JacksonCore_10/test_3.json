"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testShortNameCollisionsDirectNew` is failing at the assertion `assertEquals(1024, symbols.bucketCount());`, which indicates that the expected bucket count is 1024, but the actual value returned is 2048. This suggests that there may be an issue with how the bucket count is calculated or managed within the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` class.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **`bucketCount()`** - This method directly returns the bucket count, which is the source of the failure.\n2. **`rehash()`** - This method is responsible for resizing the hash table and could affect the bucket count if it is not implemented correctly.\n3. **`createRoot(int seed)`** - This method initializes the root `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, which may set up the initial bucket count.\n4. **`makeChild(int flags)`** - This method creates a child `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`, which may inherit properties from the parent, including bucket count.\n5. **`size()`** - This method returns the size of the canonicalizer, which may indirectly relate to how buckets are managed.\n6. **`_verifyNeedForRehash()`** - This method checks if rehashing is needed, which could impact the bucket count if the conditions are not met correctly.\n\nGiven the context of the failure, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [10, 16, 7, 8, 9, 12]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
