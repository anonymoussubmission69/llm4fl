"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testSyntheticWithBytesNew` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected primary count is 8534, but the actual count is 8524. This indicates that there is likely an issue in the methods responsible for managing the primary count of symbols in the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer`.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`addName(String name, int[] q, int qlen)`** - This method is responsible for adding names to the canonicalizer and updating the count. Any issues in this method could directly affect the primary count.\n2. **`primaryCount()`** - This method calculates the primary count. If there is a bug in how the count is calculated or updated, it could lead to discrepancies in the expected value.\n3. **`_verifyNeedForRehash()`** - This method checks if rehashing is needed based on the count. If rehashing is not handled correctly, it could affect the distribution of names and thus the primary count.\n4. **`rehash()`** - This method is responsible for rehashing the internal structures. If there are issues in how rehashing is performed, it could lead to incorrect counts.\n5. **`calcHash(int[] q, int qlen)`** - This method calculates the hash for the names being added. If the hash calculation is incorrect, it could lead to collisions and affect the count.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [12, 26, 13, 17, 30]\n}\n```"
