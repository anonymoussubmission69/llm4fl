"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testOffsetWithInputOffset` is failing due to an assertion that expected a byte offset of `0` but received `3`. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the byte offset is being calculated or returned in the `JsonLocation` class.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory:createParser([BII)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser;`** - This method is responsible for creating a parser from a byte array, which is directly related to the input being tested.\n2. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser:nextToken()Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonToken;`** - This method is responsible for advancing the parser to the next token, which may affect how the byte offset is calculated.\n3. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonLocation:getByteOffset()J`** - This method directly returns the byte offset, which is the value being asserted in the test.\n4. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.UTF8StreamJsonParser:getTokenLocation()Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonLocation;`** - This method retrieves the token location, which includes the byte offset and is likely involved in the calculation of the offset.\n5. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ByteSourceJsonBootstrapper:constructParser(ILcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/ObjectCodec;Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/BytesToNameCanonicalizer;Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/CharsToNameCanonicalizer;ZZ)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser;`** - This method constructs the parser and may influence how the input is processed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 76, 81, 75, 70]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
