"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testWonkyNumber173` is attempting to compile a `JsonPointer` with the string `\"/1e0\"`. This indicates that the test is likely checking for a valid JSON pointer syntax.\n2. The stack trace shows that a `NumberFormatException` is thrown when trying to parse the string `\"1e0\"` as an integer. This suggests that the input string is not being handled correctly in the parsing logic.\n3. The methods involved in the stack trace include `NumberInput.parseInt`, `JsonPointer._parseIndex`, and `JsonPointer.compile`, which are directly related to the parsing of the input string.\n\nThe covered methods that are suspicious and need further analysis are:\n\n- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.io.NumberInput:parseInt` (method_id: 1): This method is responsible for parsing a string into an integer and is directly implicated in the exception.\n- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer:_parseIndex` (method_id: 6): This method is involved in parsing the index from the string and may be where the invalid input is being processed.\n- `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer:compile` (method_id: 5): This method is responsible for compiling the `JsonPointer` from the input string and is the entry point for the parsing logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [1, 5, 6]\n}\n```"
