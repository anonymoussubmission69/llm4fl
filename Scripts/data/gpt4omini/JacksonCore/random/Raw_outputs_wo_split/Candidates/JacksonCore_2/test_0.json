"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testMangledNumbersBytes` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that an exception was expected but a token of type `VALUE_NUMBER_INT` was received instead. This suggests that the parsing logic is not handling certain input correctly, leading to the failure.\n\nThe stack trace points to the method `_testMangledNumbers` in the `TestParserErrorHandling` class, which is likely responsible for testing the parsing of mangled numbers. The methods that are covered by the failed test include various constructors and methods in the `JsonFactory`, `JsonParser`, and related classes.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory:createParser(Ljava/io/InputStream;)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser;`** - This method is responsible for creating a parser from an input stream, which is likely where the input is being processed.\n2. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.ByteSourceJsonBootstrapper:constructParser(ILcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/ObjectCodec;Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/BytesToNameCanonicalizer;Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/CharsToNameCanonicalizer;ZZ)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser;`** - This method constructs a parser and may be involved in the parsing logic that leads to the error.\n3. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.UTF8StreamJsonParser:_parseNumber(I)Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonToken;`** - This method is responsible for parsing numbers, which is directly related to the error encountered (receiving a number token when an exception was expected).\n4. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.UTF8StreamJsonParser:nextToken()Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonToken;`** - This method retrieves the next token from the input, and if it is not handling the input correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [5, 75, 84, 82]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
