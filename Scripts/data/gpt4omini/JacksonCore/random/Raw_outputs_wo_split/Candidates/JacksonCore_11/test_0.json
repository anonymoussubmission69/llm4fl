"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The test `testSymbolTableExpansionBytes` calls the method `_testSymbolTableExpansion`, which is likely responsible for testing the symbol table expansion functionality.\n2. The stack trace indicates that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurred in the `addName` method of the `ByteQuadsCanonicalizer` class. This suggests that there may be an issue with how names are being added to the symbol table, potentially due to an incorrect index being accessed.\n3. The exception is propagated through several methods, including `findName`, `_parseName`, and others, which are involved in the process of adding and finding names in the symbol table.\n\nGiven these points, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n- `addName(String name, int[] q, int qlen)` (method_id: 44)\n- `findName(int q1)` (method_id: 41)\n- `_parseName(int i)` (method_id: 117)\n- `_calcOffset(int hash)` (method_id: 42)\n- `_verifyNeedForRehash()` (method_id: 45)\n- `_findOffsetForAdd(int hash)` (method_id: 47)\n\nThese methods are directly involved in the name addition and retrieval process, and the exception suggests that there may be an issue with how they handle indices or the internal state of the symbol table.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [44, 41, 117, 42, 45, 47]\n}\n```"
