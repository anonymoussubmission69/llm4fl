"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testBinaryAsEmbeddedObject` is failing due to a `JsonGenerationException` that indicates \"No native support for writing embedded objects.\" This exception is thrown from the `writeEmbeddedObject` method of the `JsonGenerator` class.\n\nThe stack trace shows that the failure occurs when the `writeEmbeddedObject` method is called, which is part of the `JsonGenerator` class. The test attempts to write an embedded object using a `JsonGenerator` instance created by the `JsonFactory`.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`writeEmbeddedObject`** (method_id: 51) - This is the method that directly throws the exception.\n2. **`createGenerator`** (method_id: 5) - This method is responsible for creating the `JsonGenerator` instance used in the test.\n3. **`_createGenerator`** (method_id: 6) - This method is called by `createGenerator` and may contain logic that affects the generator's behavior.\n4. **`_decorate`** (method_id: 7) - This method is involved in decorating the writer for the generator, which could influence how data is written.\n5. **`JsonFactory` constructor methods** (method_id: 0, 1, 2) - These methods initialize the `JsonFactory` and may set up configurations that affect the generator's capabilities.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [51, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]\n}\n```"
