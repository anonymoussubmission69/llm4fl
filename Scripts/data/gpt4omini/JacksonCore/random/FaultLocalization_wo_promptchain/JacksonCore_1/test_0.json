    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `testAllowNaN()` is failing because it expected an exception with a specific message but received a `null` message instead. This suggests that there is an issue with how exceptions are being handled in the code, particularly when dealing with NaN (Not a Number) values.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 82,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _handleUnexpectedValue(int i) is responsible for handling unexpected values, including NaN.
