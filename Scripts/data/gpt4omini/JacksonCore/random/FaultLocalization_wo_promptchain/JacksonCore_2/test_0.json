    "final_full_answer": "Based on the provided test body and stack trace, the test `testMangledNumbersBytes` is failing due to an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating that an exception was expected but instead a token of type `VALUE_NUMBER_INT` was received. This suggests that the issue lies in the parsing of numbers, likely in the methods related to JSON parsing.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 84,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method _parseNumber is responsible for parsing numeric values from the input stream.
