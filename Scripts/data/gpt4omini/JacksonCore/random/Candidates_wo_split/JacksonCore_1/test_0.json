This indicates that there might be an issue with how NaN values are being handled in the JSON parsing process.\n\nThe stack trace points to the method `_testAllowNaN` in the `TestParserNonStandard` class, which suggests that the methods related to parsing numbers, particularly NaN values, are likely involved in the failure.\n\nFrom the covered methods, the following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`resetAsNaN(String valueStr, double value)`** - This method is responsible for resetting the parser state when encountering a NaN value. If it does not handle NaN correctly, it could lead to the observed failure.\n2. **`getDoubleValue()`** - This method retrieves the double value from the parser. If it does not correctly identify or handle NaN, it could also contribute to the failure.\n3. **`getDecimalValue()`** - Similar to `getDoubleValue()`, this method converts the number to a BigDecimal. If NaN handling is incorrect here, it could lead to the failure.\n4. **`convertNumberToBigDecimal()`** - This method is responsible for converting numbers to BigDecimal. If it does not handle NaN correctly, it could propagate the issue.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, as they deal with number parsing and conversion, particularly with special cases like NaN.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [71, 72, 73, 74]\n}\n```"
