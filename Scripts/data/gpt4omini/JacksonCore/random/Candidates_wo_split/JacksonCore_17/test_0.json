The stack trace indicates that the error occurs during the writing process, specifically when handling surrogate characters.\n\n2. **`_outputRawMultiByteChar`** (Method ID: 76) - This method is directly involved in processing multi-byte characters, which is relevant given the error message about a \"Split surrogate on writeRaw() input.\"\n\n3. **`_outputSurrogates`** (Method ID: 77) - This method handles the output of surrogate pairs, which is critical in the context of the error related to surrogate characters.\n\n4. **`_writeSegmentedRaw`** (Method ID: 74) - This method is involved in writing raw data in segments, which may also be related to how the data is being processed and could contribute to the error.\n\n5. **`_reportError`** (Method ID: 59) - This method is called to report errors, and it is invoked when the error condition is detected in `_outputRawMultiByteChar`. It is important to analyze how errors are reported and handled.\n\n6. **`writeRawValue`** (Method ID: 63) - This method is a higher-level method that calls `writeRaw`, and it is part of the flow that leads to the error.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [72, 76, 77, 74, 59, 63]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
