"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 27,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'nextTextValue()' is directly involved in retrieving the next text value from the XML. The test is failing because it expected '7' but got 'null', indicating that this method may not be correctly returning the expected value.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 20,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getCurrentName()' is used to retrieve the current name of the token being processed. If this method does not return the correct name, it could lead to issues in parsing the XML structure, potentially affecting the output of 'nextTextValue()'.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 26,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getText()' retrieves the text value of the current token. If this method is not functioning correctly, it could also lead to 'nextTextValue()' returning 'null' instead of the expected value.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'nextToken()' is responsible for advancing to the next token in the XML stream.
