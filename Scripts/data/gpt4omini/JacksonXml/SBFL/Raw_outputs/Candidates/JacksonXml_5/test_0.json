"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCopyWith` is failing due to an assertion that checks if the serialized XML output contains the expected names. The failure indicates that the serialization process is not producing the expected output, specifically regarding the handling of annotations in the `Pojo282` class.\n\nThe following methods are suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.XmlMapper:<init>()V`** - This is the constructor for the `XmlMapper`, which is responsible for initializing the XML serialization process.\n2. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.XmlMapper:copy()Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/XmlMapper;`** - This method creates a copy of the `XmlMapper`, which may affect how annotations are handled.\n3. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.util.XmlRootNameLookup:findNamespace(...)`** - This method is involved in determining the namespace for the XML elements, which could impact the output.\n4. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.JacksonXmlAnnotationIntrospector:findRootName(...)`** - This method is responsible for finding the root name based on annotations, which is critical for correct serialization.\n5. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.ser.XmlBeanSerializer:serialize(...)`** - This method handles the serialization of the bean, and any issues here could lead to incorrect XML output.\n6. **`com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.ser.XmlBeanSerializerBase:serializeFields(...)`** - This method serializes the fields of the bean, and any misconfiguration or incorrect handling of annotations could lead to the observed failure.\n\nThese methods are directly related to the serialization process and the handling of annotations, which are crucial for producing the expected XML output.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 90, 2, 78, 72, 73]\n}\n```"
