"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testXmlAttributesWithNextTextValue` is failing because it expected the value \"7\" but received `null`. This indicates that the method responsible for retrieving the text value from the XML parser is likely not functioning correctly.\n\nThe following methods are particularly suspicious and should be analyzed further:\n\n1. **`nextTextValue()`** (method_id: 27) - This method is directly responsible for retrieving the next text value from the XML. Since the test expected \"7\" but got `null`, this method is a prime candidate for investigation.\n\n2. **`getText()`** (method_id: 26) - This method retrieves the current text value. If `nextTextValue()` is not working correctly, it may be due to issues in how `getText()` is implemented.\n\n3. **`nextToken()`** (method_id: 14) - This method is responsible for advancing the parser to the next token. If it does not correctly identify the tokens, it could lead to incorrect behavior in `nextTextValue()`.\n\n4. **`_xmlTokens.next()`** (method_id: 24) - This method is part of the token stream and is responsible for fetching the next token. If this method does not return the expected token, it could affect the behavior of `nextTextValue()`.\n\n5. **`getCurrentName()`** (method_id: 20) - This method retrieves the current name of the token being processed. If it returns an unexpected value, it could lead to issues in parsing the XML correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [27, 26, 14, 24, 20]\n}\n```"
