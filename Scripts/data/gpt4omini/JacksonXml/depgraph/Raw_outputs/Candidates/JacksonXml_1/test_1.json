"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testNestedWithEmpty` is failing because it expected the size of `svc.vehicleMonitoringDelivery` to be 1, but it was 0. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the XML is being parsed or how the `vehicleMonitoringDelivery` is being populated.\n\nThe stack trace points to the assertion failure occurring in the `testNestedWithEmpty` method, specifically at line 100. The methods covered by the failed test include various methods from the `FromXmlParser` class, which is responsible for parsing XML data.\n\nHere are the suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further:\n\n1. **addVirtualWrapping** - This method deals with wrapping elements, which could affect how the XML is parsed and structured.\n2. **isExpectedStartArrayToken** - This method checks for the start of an array token, which is relevant since the test expects a collection size.\n3. **_isEmpty** - This method checks if a string is empty, which could be relevant if the XML elements are not being populated correctly.\n4. **getCurrentName** - This method retrieves the current name in the parsing context, which could affect how elements are being read.\n5. **getParsingContext** - This method returns the current parsing context, which is crucial for understanding the state of the parser.\n6. **createParser** - This method creates a parser instance, which is fundamental to the parsing process.\n7. **_initializeXmlReader** - This method initializes the XML reader, which is essential for correctly reading the XML structure.\n\nThese methods are interconnected and could potentially propagate the fault from one to another, leading to the observed failure in the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 7, 9]\n}\n```"
