"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testCopyWith` is failing due to an assertion error related to the XML serialization of a `Pojo282` object. The test checks if the serialized XML output contains specific names, which indicates that the serialization process is not functioning as expected.\n\nThe following methods are covered by the failed test and are potentially suspicious:\n\n1. **XmlMapper.copy()** - This method is responsible for creating a copy of the `XmlMapper` instance. If there is an issue in how the copy is made, it could lead to incorrect serialization behavior.\n2. **XmlMapper.<init>()** - The constructor initializes the `XmlMapper`. If there are issues in the initialization, it could affect the serialization process.\n3. **XmlSerializerProvider.serializeValue()** - This method is responsible for serializing the value into XML. Since the test is failing on the serialized output, this method is crucial to investigate.\n4. **XmlSerializerProvider:_rootNameFromConfig()** - This method retrieves the root name configuration, which is directly related to how the XML is structured. If the root name is not set correctly, it could lead to incorrect serialization.\n5. **XmlSerializerProvider:_initWithRootName()** - This method initializes the generator with the root name. If this is not set correctly, it could also lead to issues in the serialized output.\n\nGiven these observations, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [2, 7, 5, 11, 9]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be analyzed further to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
