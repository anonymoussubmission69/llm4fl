"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testXmlAttributesWithNextTextValue` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` where the expected value is \"7\" but the actual value is `null`. This indicates that the method responsible for retrieving the text value is likely not functioning correctly.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`nextTextValue()`** (method_id: 16): This method is directly involved in retrieving the text value from the XML parser. Since the test expects \"7\" but receives `null`, this method is a primary suspect.\n\n2. **`getText()`** (method_id: 24): This method retrieves the current text value. If `nextTextValue()` is not returning the expected value, it may be due to issues in how `getText()` is implemented or called.\n\n3. **`nextToken()`** (method_id: 15): This method is responsible for advancing the parser to the next token. If it does not correctly handle the XML structure, it could lead to `nextTextValue()` returning `null`.\n\n4. **`getCurrentName()`** (method_id: 14): This method retrieves the current name of the token being processed. If the current name is not set correctly, it could affect the retrieval of text values.\n\n5. **`XmlTokenStream:getText()`** (method_id: 24): This method is also involved in getting the text value from the XML token stream. If the token stream is not correctly set up, it could lead to incorrect values being returned.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the following JSON object summarizes the potential suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [16, 24, 15, 14, 22]\n}\n```"
