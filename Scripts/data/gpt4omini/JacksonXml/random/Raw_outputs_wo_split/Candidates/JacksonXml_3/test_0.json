"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testXmlAttributesWithNextTextValue` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` where the expected value is \"7\" but the actual value is `null`. This indicates that the method responsible for retrieving the text value is likely not functioning correctly.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`nextTextValue()`** (method_id: 16): This method is directly involved in retrieving the next text value from the XML parser. Since the test expects \"7\" but receives `null`, this method is a primary suspect.\n\n2. **`getText()`** (method_id: 24): This method retrieves the current text value. If `nextTextValue()` is not returning the expected value, it may be due to issues in how `getText()` is functioning.\n\n3. **`nextToken()`** (method_id: 15): This method is responsible for advancing the parser to the next token. If it does not correctly identify the tokens, it could lead to incorrect values being returned by `nextTextValue()`.\n\n4. **`getCurrentName()`** (method_id: 14): This method retrieves the current name of the token being processed. If the current name is not set correctly, it could affect the retrieval of text values.\n\n5. **`XmlTokenStream:next()`** (method_id: 23): This method is responsible for moving to the next token in the XML stream. If it does not function correctly, it could lead to issues in token retrieval.\n\n6. **`XmlTokenStream:getText()`** (method_id: 24): This method retrieves the text value of the current token. If the text value is not being set correctly, it could lead to the `null` value being returned.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following JSON object summarizes the suspicious methods:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [16, 24, 15, 14, 23]\n}\n``` \n\nThese methods should be examined to identify the root cause of the failure in the test."
