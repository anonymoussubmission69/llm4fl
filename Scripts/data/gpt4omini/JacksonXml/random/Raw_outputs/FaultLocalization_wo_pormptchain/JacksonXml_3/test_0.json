"Based on the provided test body, stack trace, and the covered methods, here are the suspicious methods ranked from most to least suspicious:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 16,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'nextTextValue()' is directly involved in retrieving the text value from the XML. The test is failing because it expected '7' but got 'null', indicating that this method may not be returning the expected value.\",\n        \"rank\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 15,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'nextToken()' is responsible for advancing the parser to the next token. If it does not correctly identify the next token, it could lead to incorrect parsing and thus affect the output of 'nextTextValue()'.\",\n        \"rank\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 14,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The method 'getCurrentName()' retrieves the current name of the token being processed. If this method does not return the correct name, it could affect the parsing logic and lead to unexpected results.\",\n        \"rank\": 3\n    },\n    {\n        \"method_id\": 13,\n        \"reasoning\": \"The constructor of 'FromXmlParser' initializes the parser with various parameters. If any of these parameters are incorrectly set, it could lead to issues in parsing the XML correctly.\",\n        \"rank\": 4\n    }\n]\n```"
