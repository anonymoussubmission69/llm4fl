"Based on the analysis of the test body and stack trace, the test `testXmlAttributesWithNextTextValue` is failing due to a `ComparisonFailure` where the expected value is \"7\" but the actual value returned is `null`. This indicates that the method responsible for retrieving the text value from the XML parser is likely not functioning correctly.\n\nThe suspicious methods that need to be analyzed further are:\n\n1. **`nextTextValue()`** (method_id: 16) - This method is directly involved in retrieving the text value from the XML parser. The failure indicates that it may not be returning the expected value.\n2. **`getText()`** (method_id: 24) - This method is called to get the text value from the current token. If `nextTextValue()` is not working correctly, this method may also be implicated.\n3. **`nextToken()`** (method_id: 15) - This method is responsible for advancing the parser to the next token. If it does not correctly identify the tokens, it could lead to issues in retrieving the text values.\n4. **`getCurrentName()`** (method_id: 14) - This method retrieves the current name of the token being processed. If the current name is not set correctly, it could affect the retrieval of the text values.\n\nThese methods are interconnected, and a fault in one could propagate to others, leading to the observed failure.\n\nHere is the JSON object summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"method_ids\": [16, 24, 15, 14]\n}\n```"
