As a Tester agent, I want you to list all the methods which might be highly suspicious to find the fault in the system under test. First analyze the test body and stack trace and then based on that look for the covered methods by the failed test which might be suspicious or leading to the fault. It is very important to put the exact method_signature in the final json output. The fault might propagate from one method to another.

Here is the test information:

{test_info}

Conclude your analysis with a JSON object ranking these methods and summarizing your reasoning, following the specified structure: 

{output_format}
